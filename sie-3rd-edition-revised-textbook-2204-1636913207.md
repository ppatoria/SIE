### SIE Exam and Industry Introduction {#sie-exam-and-industry-introduction .unnumbered}

###### What Is the SIE? {#what-is-the-sie .unnumbered}

> The Securities Industry Essentials (SIE or Essentials) Exam is a
> regulatory exam required for all individuals entering the securities
> business. The SIE is an introductory-level exam, which requires you to
> demonstrate a mastery of the financial industry essentials, in other
> words, all of the fundamental information that candidates entering the
> industry should know.
>
> Anyone who is 18 or older is eligible to sit for the SIE; association
> with a registered securities firm (aka a broker-dealer) is not
> required. This means you are permitted to take the exam either before
> or after being hired by a firm. This is a big change within the
> securities industry, as, historically, individuals were required to be
> employed and sponsored by a registered firm in order to take any
> qualification exams.
>
> The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), one of the
> primary regulatory bodies within the industry, has made the SIE
> available to everyone as a means to open the door to the securities
> industry and inspire more individuals to enter the business. College
> students, MBAs, career-changers, military veterans, and anyone else
> interested in pursuing a job in the financial services industry can
> take the SIE to demonstrate his or her knowledge of the business and
> stand out in the crowded field of job applicants. Passing the SIE is
> now the first step to a successful career in the securities business.
>
> However, passing the SIE Exam alone does not qualify you to engage in
> securities business. To become fully registered, you are required to
> pass a second, more specialized qualification exam (e.g., the Series
> 6, Series 7, or Series 79) based on the type of business you will
> engage in. Unlike the SIE, the Series exams can only be taken once you
> are associated with and sponsored by a registered securities firm.
>
> To account for the potential time lag between passing the SIE Exam and
> securing a job, the SIE credential is valid for four years. Therefore,
> once you pass the SIE, you will have four years to become associated
> with a broker-dealer and pass a corresponding Series exam per your
> employment.

###### How the Exam Is Structured {#how-the-exam-is-structured .unnumbered}

> The SIE is a 75-question, computer-based, multiple-choice exam, with
> each question con- sisting of four answer choices. The passing score
> on the SIE is 70%. Although your score is calculated based on 75 exam
> questions, you will actually complete 85 questions. The extra 10
> questions are ungraded, and used by FINRA for possible inclusion in
> future exams. You
>
> *SIE Exam and Industry Introduction*
>
> will not know which questions are ungraded, however, as they will be
> randomly distributed throughout your exam. You will be given 1 hour
> and 45 minutes to complete the exam.
>
> Although each exam is uniquely generated from a large question bank,
> all exams cover the same four major topic areas that FINRA deems
> essential for securities professionals to know. Questions from these
> four sections are randomly mixed through the exam. The table below
> lists the four areas, as well as the relevant chapters in this book.

> Before the exam clock begins, an online tutorial will familiarize you
> with how the system operates. The system is easy to use---no prior
> experience is necessary, though you can review the tutorial as much as
> needed before you begin the exam.
>
> Among the features of the exam are:

-   A clock display that can be turned on/off so you can track the time
    remaining

-   A confirmation box that appears each time you answer a question so
    you can confirm your answer before proceeding to the next question

-   The ability to mark questions you wish to review later so you can
    easily go back to them

-   The exam is designed so that the questions at the beginning and end
    are easier than the questions in the middle

> At the end of the allowed testing time, or when you voluntarily stop
> your exam, your score will be calculated and a score report will be
> displayed. The score report will show whether you passed the exam. You
> will be given a copy of this report when you leave the center or
> emailed a copy of the report if you take the exam remotely.

###### How to Make an Exam Appointment {#how-to-make-an-exam-appointment .unnumbered}

> The SIE Exam is administered by Prometric and can be taken either in
> person at a testing center or remotely. If you are considering taking
> the SIE through the remote testing option, we encourage you to read
> some of the requirements ahead of your planned exam date. Additional
> information on the logistics of remote examination can be found at:
> www.finra
>
> .org/registration-exams-ce/qualification-exams/testonline.
>
> The cost for scheduling the exam is \$60. You may either register
> online or call the testing center to make your appointment:

-   **Prometric**

> Call (800) 578-6273 or visit
> [www.prometric.com/finra.](http://www.prometric.com/finra)
>
> Examination appointments are offered daily, including weekend
> availability. To get your desired date, we suggest scheduling your
> test as far in advance as possible.
>
> If needed, you may cancel an exam appointment before the scheduled
> session. To avoid fees, candidates must cancel or reschedule a minimum
> of 10 business days in advance. Appointments cancelled or rescheduled
> within 10 business days will result in the assess- ment of one of the
> following fees:
>
> **Three- to Ten-Business-Day Cancellation/Reschedule Fee:**
> Individuals who cancel or reschedule an appointment within three to 10
> business days of a scheduled session will be assessed a fee equal to
> half the cost of the examination.
>
> **Late Cancellation/Reschedule Fee (Within Two Business Days of
> Appointment):** Individuals who cancel or reschedule an appointment
> within two business days of a sched- uled session, or who fail to show
> up for an exam, will incur a fee equal to the fee of the examination.

###### On the Day of Your Exam {#on-the-day-of-your-exam .unnumbered}

> Plan to arrive at the testing center or online appointment 30 minutes
> before your scheduled appointment time. You will need to provide a
> valid government-issued form of ID with your signature and your
> picture. Acceptable forms of ID include your driver's license,
> passport, or military ID.
>
> The exam is closed-book, and you cannot bring any notes, books, or
> other materials into the examination. When taking the exam in-person,
> any personal effects (e.g., phones, laptops, watches, etc.) must be
> left in a locker or another location provided by the testing center.
> The center's staff will provide candidates with scratch
> paper---typically laminated paper with a dry-erase marker---and a
> basic, four-function calculator. Do not bring your own calculator with
> you for your exam---you will not be allowed to use it.
>
> Candidates taking the examination remotely will be provided an online
> calculator and online notepad in lieu of the physical resources. You
> cannot use your own calculator or scratch paper.
>
> Some students find the resources provided to be of a poorer quality
> than those they used while studying for the exam. Specifically, the
> calculator may be quite small, with few digits available on the
> screen. This will require you to abbreviate numbers when doing
> calcula- tions---for example, 14.7 instead of 14,700,000. It is a good
> idea to practice using a similarly small, four-function calculator.

###### Knopman Marks Method {#knopman-marks-method .unnumbered}

> We are excited to help you get started, prepare for, and ultimately
> pass your SIE exam!
>
> Start by reviewing our step-by-step **Action Plan**. The Action Plan
> is found on our Training Center at
> [www.knopman.com](http://www.knopman.com/) and is the best approach to
> get on the path to success. The Action Plan is critical: following
> each step as listed is key and it is our recommended plan of attack.
>
> *SIE Exam and Industry Introduction*
>
> *SIE Exam and Industry Introduction*
>
> Additionally, below are a few helpful tips that you should keep in
> mind as you start the SIE study process:

-   Make the exam a high priority: set aside study time each day,
    including weekends -- even if it's just forty-five minutes or an
    hour. Limiting your preparation to weekends only is often
    counterproductive and inefficient, as you will forget much of what
    you studied if you go four or five days without reviewing the
    information.

-   Be sure to study in a quiet, well-lit place to maximize your
    productivity. Minimize all distractions and dedicate yourself to
    focused, productive studying.

-   Keep in mind that **the goal of reading this textbook is general
    understanding, rather than retention. We do not recommend taking
    notes while you read** (though highlighting is fine). The retention
    will come later when you watch our online lectures and work through
    the practice exams.

-   When watching the online lectures on the Knopman.com Training
    Center, take detailed notes by hand. This results in better
    retention and recollection than typing. These lectures focus on the
    most heavily tested and difficult concepts on the exam.

-   As you complete our practice exams use only new questions from the
    question bank to ensure that you are grasping and mastering the
    concepts, rather than simply memorizing previously seen questions.
    Read the answer and rationale for each practice question so that you
    can understand why you got the question right or wrong.

-   Although our practice questions are similar to the questions you
    will see on the exam, they are not exact replicas. You may even see
    questions on your exam that cover information you don't feel
    prepared for. Remain confident -- if you have prepared well and
    followed our Action Plan, you will be successful on the exam.

> We are mindful that everyone learns differently, but we ask that you
> stick to the Action Plan when starting off. Whether on a tight
> timeline or not, your studying methods will naturally evolve as you
> progress through the steps in the Action Plan and you will find some
> resources more useful than others.
>
> Lastly, our materials are constantly being updated to reflect new
> content and rule changes. To account for that, please make sure to
> enter your exam date in the Training Center once it is confirmed with
> Prometric so that we can send you any important updates leading up to
> your exam.

> studying!

###### Financial Industry Introduction {#financial-industry-introduction .unnumbered}

> While the essential aspects of the securities business will be
> discussed throughout this text- book, it is important that you have a
> foundational knowledge of all major players within the industry---both
> the regulators of the industry as well as market participants.

#########  [Regulatory Entities and Agencies]{.underline}  {#regulatory-entities-and-agencies .unnumbered}

> The securities markets contain trillions of dollars of invested cash.
> Because so much is at stake, the financial industry is very heavily
> regulated in order to maintain the integrity and fairness of the
> financial system. This regulation may be handled by both government
> and non-government entities. This section will introduce the key
> regulators that SIE candidates need to be familiar with.

-   **The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**---You can think of
    the SEC as the "top watchdog" of the securities industry. It is the
    government agency primarily responsible for enforcing federal
    securities laws, such as the Securities Act of 1933, which regulates
    new issues of securities, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    which regulates the secondary marketplace, including securities
    trading and exchanges.

-   **Self-regulatory organizations (SROs)**---Organizations that are
    delegated authority by the SEC to handle some of the day-to-day
    regulation and oversight of the securities business. The three main
    SROs that are covered on this exam are:

    -   **Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)**---The world's largest
        > options exchange, which is also tasked with regulating the
        > options marketplace and options trading

    -   **Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)**---Focuses on
        > protecting investors through the registration and regulation
        > of brokerage firms and their employees. FINRA is the entity
        > that requires qualification exams, including the SIE.

    -   **Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)**---Responsible
        > for regulating the municipal securities industry and all
        > securities firms and professionals involved in the trading,
        > underwriting, sales, and advising of municipal securities

-   **Treasury Department**---A federal-government department that is
    primarily responsible for managing the finances (revenues and
    expenses) of the US government. The Treasury includes a number of
    bureaus that are designed to carry out specific operations. The
    three essential bureaus that are covered on the SIE Exam are:

    -   **Internal Revenue Service (IRS)**---Responsible for collecting
        > tax revenue and administering tax laws

    -   **Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)**---Works with
        > banks and other financial institutions to prevent financial
        > crimes, such as money laundering

> *SIE Exam and Industry Introduction*
>
> *SIE Exam and Industry Introduction*

-   **Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)**---Maintains a list of
    persons, entities, and countries that the US is prohibited from
    doing business with. Examples include terrorists and countries for
    which the US has sanctions, such as North Korea

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Federal Reserve (the Fed)**---The central bank in the US,
    responsible for determining the amount of money in circulation to
    influence economic growth, inflation, unemployment, and currency
    exchange rates. The Fed has three main tools to achieve its goals,
    all of which will be discussed in detail: 1) open market
    transactions, 2) the discount rate, and 3) reserve requirements.

-   **Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)**---A
    not-for-profit corporation that protects customer brokerage accounts
    in the event that a broker-dealer goes bankrupt.

-   **Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)**---A US government
    corporation that insures customer bank deposits. Note that the SIPC
    protects brokerage accounts (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.),
    while the FDIC protects bank accounts (savings and checking
    accounts).

-   **State regulators (NASAA)**---In addition to federal regulation,
    each state has securities laws in place designed to protect the
    investing public. NASAA, which is the North American Securities
    Administrators Association, is the advisory body of state securities
    regulators that creates many of these laws and state-registration
    requirements. These state regulations are often referred to as
    **blue sky laws**.

#########  [Market Participants]{.underline}  {#market-participants .unnumbered}

> In addition to the regulators that keep a watchful eye on the
> securities industry, it is import- ant to know about the various
> market participants involved in securities transactions and in
> facilitating trades. As you will see throughout this textbook, trading
> is more complicated than one party buying and one party selling. All
> the other parties that support these trades, from broker-dealers to
> clearing corporations, must be considered. This section will intro-
> duce key market participants that SIE candidates need to be familiar
> with.

-   **Investors**---The individuals, corporations, governments, and
    other entities that invest, i.e., that purchase and sell securities.
    As we will discuss, not every security is appropriate for every
    investor, so it is important to distinguish between different types
    of investors, a few of which are detailed below:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Retail investors**---Individuals who buy and sell securities for
    their own personal accounts. These investors typically trade in the
    smallest amounts and often in the least advanced types of
    securities. Because they often lack industry sophistication, retail
    investors are granted the greatest protections by federal and state
    regulators.

-   **Institutional investors**---Large institutions, such as mutual
    funds, banks, and insurance companies, that trade securities for
    their investment portfolios. Because these institutions are
    typically more sophisticated, they more freely engage in larger and
    more complicated transactions.

    -   **Accredited investors**---Includes high-net-worth individuals
        > and institutions. These investors are permitted to freely
        > invest in **private placements**, i.e., the securities of
        > private companies that have not been publicly registered with
        > the SEC. Because private-placement securities are considered
        > extremely risky, only high-net-worth individuals and
        > institutions can invest, as they can afford this risk.

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   **Broker-dealers**---Sometimes referred to in this textbook as
        **brokerage firms**, these firms trade securities for their own
        accounts or on behalf of their customers. You can think of
        broker-dealers as the heart and soul of the securities business,
        as they are the main facilitators of securities trading.
        Depending on which services they offer and the nature of their
        business, broker-dealers fall into different categories and are
        subject to different FINRA regulations:

        -   **Introducing firm**---A broker-dealer that has a direct
            > relationship with clients. Introducing firms open client
            > accounts, recommend appropriate trades, and place orders,
            > but they do not handle the mechanics of the settlement
            > process.

        -   **Clearing firm**---A broker-dealer that handles back-office
            > details of the trade to ensure the transaction
            > successfully settles, meaning the buyer actually gets the
            > purchased security and the seller actually receives
            > payment.

        -   **Prime broker**---A broker-dealer that facilitates large
            > and complex trading operations, such as those of hedge
            > funds, by offering a set of bundled and specialized
            > services to those clients. Examples of services that might
            > be provided include clearing services, risk-management,
            > financing, and securities lending.

    -   **Issuer**---Includes both corporations and governments that
        sell securities (either stocks or bonds) to raise capital. When
        these new securities are sold to the public, they must be
        appropriately registered with the SEC unless an exemption from
        registration exists.

    -   **Underwriter**---A firm that helps an issuer market and sell
        securities to investors. To accomplish this, in many deals,
        especially public offerings (private versus public offerings are
        discussed later), the underwriter will buy the securities from
        the issuer and look to resell them to the public. Whatever the
        underwriter cannot resell, it owns and is financially liable
        for. In most public offerings, a group of underwriters work
        together to spread out this risk.

    -   **Investment adviser**---Any person or firm that provides
        securities-related advice to customers on a regular basis for a
        fee. Advisers can manage accounts ranging from individual
        portfolios to entire mutual fund portfolios. Investment advisers
        are regulated under the SEC's Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

    -   **Municipal advisor**---Any person or firm that provides advice
        to a municipal entity (e.g., a state or city) with respect to
        municipal-securities issuances or investments. For example, a
        firm advising New York City on how to structure an offering of
        securities would be a municipal advisor.

    -   **Market maker**---A firm that stands ready to buy and sell a
        specified number of shares of stock at a publicly quoted price
        during normal market hours. Market makers help create liquidity
        in the market, allowing shares to be easily bought or

> *SIE Exam and Industry Introduction*
>
> *SIE Exam and Industry Introduction*
>
> sold. There is one designated market maker per security on the New
> York Stock Exchange, whereas on Nasdaq there can be many market makers
> per security.

-   **Trader**---An individual employed by broker-dealers and other
    financial institutions to conduct the actual trading of securities.
    Those who work on the "buy side" handle the portfolio management and
    investment needs of asset management companies and other
    institutional investors, such as mutual funds and insurance
    companies. Those who work on the "sell side" manage the inventory
    and trading of the broker-dealer.

-   **Custodian**---A person that is responsible for managing another
    individual's account and making investment decisions for that
    person. For example, a parent that is managing their child's minor
    account would be considered a custodian.

-   **Trustee**---An entity, typically a large bank, that is legally
    empowered to act in the best interest of bondholders by ensuring the
    issuer meets all its promises

-   **Transfer agent**---A person who maintains records regarding the
    transfer or exchange of securities between investors to ensure that
    ownership is properly assigned in each transaction

-   **Depositories and clearing corporations**---Corporations that
    facilitate the exchange of securities and the resulting payment
    between investors by centralizing and standardizing the settlement
    process. In addition, these corporations take on counterparty risk
    by stepping between the original buyer and seller of the contract
    and guaranteeing the financial obligations of the contract.

    -   **Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)**---A holding
        company that consists of five separate clearing corporations,
        making it the world's largest financial company offering the
        clearing activities mentioned above

    -   **Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)**---The world's largest
        clearing corporation for options trades (discussed later)

### Equity Securities

> Corporations are business entities that are owned by their investors.
> In order to raise money to operate, corporations often sell
> securities, including stocks and bonds. **Stock** is equity capital,
> which means it gives buyers an ownership stake in the corporation. An
> investor owning even one share of stock will have a claim on the
> company's assets and profits.
>
> This chapter will discuss the types of **equity securities** as well
> as the terms, procedures, and characteristics associated with them.

####### Chapter Goals {#chapter-goals .unnumbered}

-   Know the rights, features, and risks of owning common stock.

-   Differentiate between common stock, preferred stock, rights,
    warrants, and ADRs.

-   Understand the types of preferred stock and their impact on a
    customer's return.

-   Describe the dividend payment process and its sequence of events.

-   Calculate the impact of stock splits and stock dividends on an
    investor's position.

-   Understand short sales and their objective.

####### Key Terms {#key-terms .unnumbered}

-   **Common stock**---Equity security that represents ownership, giving
    investors a claim on the company's assets and earnings, and offering
    the potential for growth (capital gains) and/or income (dividends)

-   **Preferred stock**---Equity security that represents ownership that
    is senior in priority to common stock. It pays a regular, fixed
    dividend payment.

-   **Rights**---Allow shareholders to buy shares to maintain their
    proportionate ownership in the company if the company issues
    additional shares

-   **Warrants**---Give an investor the ability to purchase a company's
    stock at a fixed price for a set period of time; generally, they are
    provided by the company in conjunction with another security (e.g.,
    a bond or preferred stock) to make the security more attractive.

-   **American depositary receipts (ADRs)**---Facilitate the US trading
    of foreign common stock

-   **Dividends**---Distributions of a company's profits to
    shareholders; they are generally paid in cash or in additional
    shares of stock and must be declared by the company's board of
    directors.

> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities

-   **Ex-dividend date**---The first date that when an investor buys
    common stock, the investor will not receive the dividend because
    they will not be on the books and records of the company in time

-   **Stock split**---An artificial adjustment of a company's stock
    price and number of shares, with no actual change to the total value
    of the issuer or of an investor's position

-   **Short sale**---A transaction in which an investor, believing the
    price will decline, sells borrowed shares in the market, hoping to
    buy back and replace the shares at a lower price than what they were
    initially sold for

###### Common Stock

> **Common stock** is the most widely held equity security. These shares
> are purchased primarily for the appreciation potential they provide if
> the issuing company performs well and increases in value. Until the
> late 1990s, purchasers received physical **stock certificates** that
> represented their ownership interest in the corporation. Now, almost
> all common stockholders are handled in **book-entry form**, which
> means that, rather than the investor receiving a certificate, the
> broker-dealer keeps a record in its books of the ownership of that
> particular security.
>
> A Disney stock certificate can be seen below.
>
> ![](media/image2.png)
>
> When a company decides to offer stock to the public, the state in
> which it is incorporated must approve the number of shares the
> corporation can sell. This approved number of shares is called
> **authorized stock**. The shares of authorized stock that are sold to
> the public are known as **issued stock**, and are referred to as
> **outstanding shares** when they are in the hands of investors. Shares
> that are issued to investors and subsequently repurchased by the
> company are **treasury shares**. **Treasury stock** is not included
> when calculating a compa- ny's total outstanding shares.
>
> ***Example***
>
> A company with 10 million shares outstanding buys back one million
> shares. This repur- chase will reduce the company's outstanding share
> count to nine million, with one million shares now considered treasury
> stock.
>
> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities
>
> Some states require that the authorized shares be assigned a nominal
> value to provide a minimum amount of legal capital to pay creditors.
> This is the stock's **par value** and is often
>
> \$1 or less. Par value for common stock is not at all relevant to
> investors. Par value is set low because the stock cannot be issued for
> less than par value. In some states, stock can also be issued as
> **no-par value**.

######### [Ownership Rights of Common Stock]{.underline} 

> As an owner of the company's common stock, a **shareholder** is
> entitled to certain legal rights of ownership. In addition to the
> right to transfer the ownership of shares to someone else by sale or
> gift, other substantial rights are associated with stock ownership.

1.  ***Limited Liability***

> Just as investors profit as the company's value increases, they risk a
> decline in the value of their investments if the corporation performs
> poorly. Put another way, they can lose money. However, shareholders
> have **limited liability**, which means that they are only on the hook
> for the amount invested and cannot lose more than their original
> investment.

2.  ***Voting Rights***

> Holders of common stock exercise control by electing a board of
> directors and voting on cor- porate policy. Each share of stock
> generally gives the shareholder one vote for each director position.
> Voting may be carried out by one of two methods:

-   **Statutory voting** allows the shareholder to vote one time per
    share for each seat on the board of directors. For example, if an
    investor owns 10 common shares and

> two board seats are to be filled, the investor has up to 10 votes to
> cast for each of two directors seeking election to the board.

-   **Cumulative voting** allows the shareholder to pool votes together
    and then allocate them as desired. Using the example above, the
    shareholder has a total of 20 votes for the 10 shares that are held
    (10 votes for each of the two seats). The shareholder can cast 20
    votes for one candidate, 15 for one candidate and five for another,
    or any other allocation preferred by the investor.

> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities
>
> ***Example***
>
> Tarik owns 200 shares of XYZ Corp and 200 shares of ABC Corp XYZ
> offers statutory voting rights, whereas ABC offers cumulative voting
> rights. Both companies have five seats on the board and nine directors
> seeking election. Tarik's proxies for each of the companies are below.

> ***Note:*** Under statutory voting rights, Tarik can vote up to 200
> times for each of five directors.
>
> With cumulative voting rights, Tarik has 1,000 total votes (5 Seats Ã
> 200 Shares) and can allocate those votes in any manner he chooses.
>
> If a stockholder cannot attend a meeting to vote in person, votes can
> be cast by **proxy**
>
> through an absentee ballot.
>
> Most securities positions are held in **street name**, where the
> broker-dealer with the cus- tomer's account is the nominal owner and
> the customer is the beneficial owner. Being the beneficial owner means
> the customer retains all rights of ownership, including the right to
> vote. Street name registration allows for ease of transfer when
> securities are bought and sold. In the case of street name ownership,
> the broker-dealer must promptly forward all proxy materials to the
> beneficial owner.
>
> **Proxy statements** are SEC-required disclosures that are sent to
> solicit shareholder votes for the election of corporate directors at
> annual meetings and for material corporate events, such as mergers.
> The information contained in proxy materials must be filed with the
> SEC in advance of the shareholder solicitation, and the proxy must
> disclose all important facts upon which shareholders are to vote.
> Although a formal proxy statement is usually dozens of pages, proxy
> cards contain the information in a condensed form. Google's proxy card
> can be seen below.

1.  ***Financial Reports and Company Information***

> Shareholders have the right to access certain financial information
> about the company and to receive audited financial reports, for
> example a **Form 10-K**. Furthermore, shareholders may inspect the
> company's books, its records, and minutes from shareholder meetings.
> This information is usually made available in an annual report to
> shareholders.

2.  ***Claim to Company Assets and Earnings***

> Common stockholders are on the bottom of the priority ladder for
> ownership claims. In the event of **liquidation**, or bankruptcy,
> common shareholders have rights to a company's assets only after
> bondholders, general creditors, and preferred shareholders have been
> paid in full.
>
> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities

3.  ***Dividends***

> Investors that buy stock can earn a profit in two ways:

-   **Capital gains**, which is the buying of stock at one price and
    selling it at a higher price. Take note, investors only pay taxes on
    realized capital gains, which is generated when an investor sells a
    security for a profit. Unrealized capital gains, which is the
    increase in value of the security, is not taxed until the investor
    actually sells it. These are sometimes referred to as **paper**
    gains and have no immediate tax impact.

-   **Dividends**

> Common shareholders have the right to receive dividend distributions
> declared by the board of directors. **Dividends** are a share of the
> corporation's profits; if they are to be paid, a speci- fied amount is
> allocated for each outstanding share. For example, a company could pay
> a div- idend of \$0.25 per share. Companies may choose not to pay
> dividends and instead reinvest profits for greater growth, as is
> commonly done by growth or research-oriented companies.
>
> When the stock market declines, holders of dividend-paying stocks
> still receive income, which may attract income-seeking investors even
> in a poor market.
>
> Dividend payment procedures will be discussed in detail later in this
> chapter.

1.  ***Pre-Emptive Rights***

> One way a company can raise additional capital is by offering new
> shares to existing share- holders. A **rights offering** gives
> shareholders the right to acquire additional shares, propor- tionate
> to their current holdings, at a stated price. In this scenario, common
> shareholders are given **pre-emptive rights**, also known as
> **subscription rights**.
>
> This practice gives current owners the option of maintaining their
> proportionate ownership interest in the company and preventing
> **dilution**, or the reduction of their ownership interest.
>
> ***Example***
>
> If a shareholder owns 5% of a company, and the company issues 100,000
> new shares of stock, the company will allow the shareholder to buy at
> least 5,000 shares of stock at a specified price before it is offered
> to the public. The shareholder can opt to purchase all, some, or none
> of the 5,000 new shares.
>
> Because new shares available through rights are sold at a discount,
> the rights have value and are traded separately on the open market. If
> the rights are trading separately, the stock is said to be trading
> **ex-rights** and is worth less than the same stock with rights
> attached.
>
> Pre-emptive rights are rare for US companies, and their existence is
> determined either by the law of the state in which the corporation
> resides or its corporate charter.

> ***[1.1.1.7 Warrants]{.underline}***
>
> Like a right, a **warrant** entitles the holder to buy the issuer's
> stock at a specified price for a period of time. However, a warrant is
> a long-term instrument, generally five years or more in term, and the
> exercise price of the warrant is usually substantially higher than the
> stock price at the time of issue. Warrants become exercisable only if
> the stock appreciates over the long term above the exercise price.
>
> Warrants are frequently attached to bonds or preferred stock as a
> sweetener, allowing the issuer to pay a lower interest rate or
> dividend. Like rights, warrants may also trade separately on the open
> market.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Facebook is issuing bonds, and to make the issuance more marketable to
> investors, Facebook attaches a warrant to the bond. The warrant has a
> strike price of \$250, allow- ing investors to purchase shares of
> Facebook at the price of \$250 per share. If Facebook is currently
> only worth \$175 per share, an investor would not want to exercise the
> warrant and buy Facebook at \$250. When would the investor want to
> exercise the warrant? The investor would want to exercise if the price
> of Facebook increases *above* \$250 per share. For example, if
> Facebook stock is worth \$300 per share, an investor would love to
> exercise
>
> his warrant and buy at the discounted price of \$250.

###### Classifying Common Stock

> The type of stock that is most appropriate for an investor depends on
> factors such as the investor's financial profile and the economic
> environment. This section will examine some of the key categories of
> common stock and identify the features that make it suitable for
> meeting different investment objectives.

######### [Classification by Investment Profile]{.underline} 

> Stocks may be classified by their investment characteristics. These
> characteristics help regis- tered representatives determine what
> stocks to recommend to investors who have different investment
> objectives.

1.  ***Blue Chip Stocks***

> Stocks of large, stable companies with a long history of steady
> earnings and dividends are known as **blue chip stocks**. These are
> issues of well-known companies, many of which are included in the Dow
> Jones Industrial Average and trade on the New York Stock Exchange
> (NYSE) or Nasdaq. General Electric, IBM, Coca-Cola, and Pfizer are
> examples of blue chip stocks. Because of their size, they offer modest
> growth potential but produce a steady income stream because they
> generally pay a consistent dividend.

2.  ***Income Stocks***

> **Income stocks** produce income---typically in the form of
> dividends---for their investors. These are generally companies that
> operate in mature industries and have low investments in research and
> development. Utility stocks are an example of stock that pays steady
> income. REITs, discussed later, also pay regular dividends.

3.  ***Cyclical Stocks***

> **Cyclical stocks** mirror the economy, strengthening when the economy
> is growing and declining in value as the economy contracts. Companies
> that supply capital equipment for businesses or high-ticket consumer
> items, such as cars and large appliances, are cyclical.

4.  ***Defensive Stocks***

> **Defensive stocks** are resistant to changes in economic cycles. Even
> when most consumers and businesses cut back spending, some companies
> continue to profit because they supply a basic need, offer a way to
> cut costs, or have the lowest prices. Examples of defensive stocks
> include utility stocks, stocks of staple consumer items, and stocks of
> discount retailers like Wal-Mart.
>
> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities

5.  ***Growth Stocks***

> **Growth stocks** are stocks of companies that reinvest most of their
> earnings into their busi- nesses. Growth stocks are considered risky.
> If a growth-oriented company doesn't grow as fast as anticipated, its
> price will drop, even if earnings remain stable. Investors purchase
> growth stocks for their potential to produce capital gains.

######### [Penny Stocks]{.underline} 

> A **penny stock** is an unlisted stock trading for less than \$5 per
> share. If a security is **unlisted** that means the security is not
> found on a national stock exchange, such as Nasdaq or the NYSE.
> Instead, penny stocks trade in the **over-the-counter (OTC)
> marketplace** and are quoted on the **OTC Markets** (previously known
> as OTC Pink or Pink Sheets) or other similar venues.
>
> Investors purchase penny stocks with the goal of capital appreciation.
> Because of their low stock price and general lack of liquidity, penny
> stocks are considered extremely risky secu- rities. Additionally,
> because of their speculative nature and the fact that historically
> there has been a higher risk of fraud and manipulation associated with
> these securities, registered representatives are subject to heightened
> regulatory requirements when soliciting (or initi- ating) penny stock
> transactions with a client.
>
> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities

######  Risks of Owning Common Stock

> Potential benefits of purchasing common stock include growth and
> income. However, there are no guarantees that an investment will
> achieve these results. The two major risks asso- ciated with common
> stock investments are described below.

######### Systematic Risk

> Often referred to as overall **market risk**, **systematic risk**, or
> **systemic risk**, this risk reflects the fact that the performance of
> an individual security will be impacted by the performance of the
> overall market.
>
> ***Example***
>
> If the S&P 500 falls 3%, it is likely that an investor's Facebook
> investment will also decline that day.
>
> Market risk cannot be avoided through **diversification**, which is a
> risk-management tech- nique that mixes a wide variety of investments
> within a portfolio. The rationale behind diver- sification is that the
> positive performance of some investments will neutralize the negative
> performance of others. But, if the market drops today, most sectors
> and securities are likely to fall with it.
>
> Some common sources of systematic risk are recessions, wars,
> significant political events, and interest rate changes. Though
> systematic risk cannot be avoided through diversification, it can be
> hedged with investments in **derivatives**, such as options, which
> will be discussed in a later chapter. These investments create
> offsetting positions that can protect the portfolio by either limiting
> loss or locking in a certain amount of gain.

######### Non-Systematic Risk

> Unlike systematic risk, which influences a large number of assets,
> **non-systematic/non-sys- temic risk**, also referred to as **business
> risk**, generally will not impact an investor's entire portfolio. For
> this reason, it is often called **specific risk**. Changes in
> corporate management or product recalls, which could impact a single
> stock, are examples of what can present this type of risk. The best
> protection against non-systematic risk is portfolio diversification,
> meaning the investor should not put all of his eggs in one basket.
>
> Another way of thinking about business risk is that it represents the
> possibility of a company making poor decisions that negatively impact
> the performance of its stock.

###### Depositary Receipts

> Many investors prefer to diversify their portfolio holdings with
> ownership of foreign securi- ties. However, buying foreign stock can
> be cumbersome due to foreign regulation and cur- rency issues.
> Depositary receipts provide domestic investors convenient access to
> foreign shares. Like US stocks, they offer the potential for capital
> appreciation and dividend income.

######### [American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)]{.underline} 

> **American depositary receipts (ADRs)** represent ownership in the
> shares of non-US com- panies that trade in US financial markets. ADRs
> are made available to US markets by major commercial banks that
> provide depositary services. These banks purchase a bulk lot of shares
> from foreign companies, bundle the shares into groups, and re-issue
> them on either a US exchange or over-the-counter. These shares are
> denominated in US dollars and dividends are paid to the domestic
> investors in US dollars. For example, investors purchasing Toyota
> "stock" on the NYSE are actually purchasing ADRs that represent
> ownership of the shares. But to an investor, it doesn't make a
> difference.

> ***[1.4.1.1 Risks of Owning ADRs]{.underline}***
>
> Although ADRs offer hassle-free opportunity for foreign ownership,
> they present additional risks compared to domestic investments.

-   **Political risk**---Is the government in the home country of the
    ADR stable?

-   **Currency risk**---Is the currency of the home country of the ADR
    stable? If a country's currency is devalued, it will impact the
    value of ADRs even if the company had been performing well. It will
    also impact the value of the dividend, which is converted from the
    issuer's home currency into US dollars.

-   **Inflationary risk**---Is inflation a substantial risk in the home
    country of the ADR? If so, it can cause devaluation of the country's
    currency, which will impact the ADR's value.

1.  (**C**) A rights offering gives existing common shareholders the
    option to purchase sufficient shares of a new equity offering so
    that their positions will not be diluted by the offering. By taking
    advantage of the rights offering, they can maintain the same
    proportionate (percentage) ownership.

2.  (**B**) Preferred stock is a type of equity security that has
    investment characteristics and investor objectives that are more
    comparable to bonds. The preferred issue pays a regular fixed
    dividend that investors can use for current income.

3.  (**A**) By eliminating paper stock certificates, book-entry form has
    enabled more efficient markets and more rapid trading. Each
    broker-dealer holds shares of stock in its own name and maintains
    records of individual account ownership. This form is also called
    street name.

4.  (**D**) A share of common stock is issued when it is authorized by
    the company and sold to the public. It is outstanding when it is
    actually in the hands of investors. Public companies may hold
    treasury stock for a time before issuing it, in which case it is

> not outstanding. Also, if companies buy back their stock from the
> public, it is no longer outstanding because if investors don't
> actually hold the stock, it isn't outstanding.

5.  (**B**) Income stocks pay high dividends, which can continue even
    when stock prices are weak. Defensive stocks are resistant to
    changes in economic cycles. They tend to hold value better than many
    other stocks during down markets.

6.  (**B**) Owners of common stock have the right to exercise control by
    electing a board of directors and, in some cases, voting on company
    policies that have been put to a proxy vote by the board of
    directors. The board chooses the CEO and is responsible for
    approving strategic direction and declaring dividends.

7.  (**B**) Systematic risk, also called market risk, reflects the fact
    that the performance of an individual stock is usually heavily
    impacted by the direction of the market as a whole. Virtually all
    stocks have systematic risk exposure and can be expected to decline
    in a broad market selloff.

8.  (**D**) Penny stocks are unlisted and trade for less than \$5 per
    share. They are found in the over-the-counter market and quoted on
    the OTC Markets or similar venues. They are considered highly risky
    due to their low share price and volatility.

######  Preferred Stock

> **Preferred stock** is another type of equity security that is issued
> by corporations. Although it is categorized as an equity security, it
> features characteristics of both stocks and bonds. Once issued, shares
> of preferred can be listed and trade on stock exchanges, or
> over-the-counter.

######### [Features of Preferred Stock]{.underline} 

> Preferred stock differs from common in three particular ways:

-   Voting rights

-   Liquidation priority

-   Dividend payments

    1.  ***Voting Rights***

> Unlike common stockholders, preferred stockholders usually have no
> voting privileges. However, sometimes corporations will permit
> preferred shareholders to vote in certain cir- cumstances, such as the
> issuance of a new class of preferred stock or in the event of a
> hostile takeover attempt.

2.  ***Liquidation Priority***

> Preferred shareholders have priority over common stockholders in the
> event of a corporate liquidation. All creditors, including
> bondholders, have precedence over preferred, but if assets remain,
> preferred shareholders will receive at least the par value of their
> shares and possibly **dividends in arrears**---missed dividend
> payments---before common shareholders receive anything.

3.  ***Dividend Payments***

> The biggest difference between preferred stock and common stock is
> that preferred stock almost always pays a quarterly dividend. As with
> common, there are no guarantees of divi- dend payment, but companies
> are reluctant to skip a preferred stock dividend, and investors can
> generally count on a preferred stock dividend being paid.
>
> Par value is more significant to preferred stockholders than to common
> stockholders because the dividend rate is expressed as a percentage of
> par value.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Assume ABC Corp has issued a 6% preferred with a par value of \$100.
> Even if the stock is currently trading for \$110, the annual dividend
> will remain \$6 (6% of \$100) or \$1.50 per quarter.
>
> Additionally, because of this fixed dividend, preferred stock trades
> like a debt security, meaning that it is susceptible to changing
> interest rates. For example, when interest rates increase, a company
> must now issue preferred stock that pays a higher dividend to compete
>
> with higher-yielding debt securities. Therefore, outstanding preferred
> stock that pays a lower dividend will lose value since it does not
> provide a competitive income stream.
>
> Furthermore, unlike common stock, which has the potential for
> unlimited upside (the stock price keeps going up), preferred stock
> typically has much less price movement and volatility. This is because
> the return on preferred stock is tied primarily to the dividend
> payments, which caps the investor's upside appreciation (as well as
> downside risk).

######### [Types of Preferred Stock]{.underline} 

> Although there are many varieties of preferred securities, the basic
> types of preferred stock are described here.
>
> **Cumulative preferred stock** includes a provision that gives
> shareholders the right to receive dividends in arrears. In other
> words, if a dividend is skipped or cancelled, the cumulative preferred
> shareholder must receive dividends for both the current period and any
> previ- ously skipped dividends before a dividend payment can be made
> to common stockholders. Preferred stock that does not have this
> feature is **straight preferred**. Straight preferred stock does not
> offer any of the features described in this section.
>
> **Participating preferred stock** allows the holder to receive an
> extra dividend distribution. This is generally conditional; for
> example, it may be triggered if the dividend payable to com- mon stock
> exceeds a certain amount. Or, it could pay a higher dividend based on
> company earnings.
>
> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities
>
> **Convertible preferred stock** gives the holder the option to
> exchange the preferred shares for shares of the issuer's common stock
> according to a defined ratio that is based on par value. For example,
> if a preferred share has par value of \$100 and can be exchanged to
> com- mon shares at a price of \$20 per share, the conversion ratio is
> five. This ratio is fixed and is based on the preferred stock's par
> value, regardless of its market price. Shares of convertible preferred
> stock offer investors the upside potential of common stock. Therefore,
> convertible preferred generally pays a lower dividend than
> nonconvertible preferred from the same issuer.
>
> **Callable preferred stock** can be repurchased by the issuing company
> at its discretion. If the shares are called, the investor is required
> to sell them back to the issuer. The company may choose to do this
> when it can acquire investment capital at a lower rate. For example,
> if interest rates fall, a company may be able to issue new stock with
> a lower dividend.
>
> Due to this **call risk**, callable preferred stock generally pays a
> higher dividend than non-call- able preferred stock from the same
> issuer.
>
> **Adjustable-rate preferred stock** pays dividends that are determined
> based on an underly- ing benchmark---usually the US Treasury bill.
> Because the dividends of adjustable-rate pre- ferred stock always vary
> based on market conditions, the share price tends to remain stable.

###### Negotiability of Equity Securities

> A **negotiable security** is one that can be freely transferred,
> assigned, or delivered to another entity. Put differently, negotiable
> securities can be easily traded to another investor. Listed equity
> securities are generally negotiable.

######### [Registrar and Transfer Agent]{.underline} 

> The **registrar** maintains records of ownership of securities by
> matching each share of stock against an ownership record and ensuring
> there is no unauthorized issuance. For example, a company cannot issue
> more shares than allowed by its corporate charter.
>
> The **transfer agent** records changes of ownership in securities and
> may maintain records of ownership. When securities are transferred or
> sold, the record of ownership is changed on the books of the issuer,
> as maintained by the transfer agent.
>
> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities
>
> Generally, the same institution will act as both registrar and
> transfer agent on an issuance.
>
> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities

######### [Stock Endorsements]{.underline} 

> To be negotiable, physical stock certificates generally must be
> endorsed with the owner's signature on the back---exactly as the
> owner's name appears on the front. Once endorsed, stock certificates
> can be assigned or sold to another person. The registrar or transfer
> agent is authorized to modify the issuer's records to reflect the
> change.
>
> Endorsing ownership of a stock certificate to a brokerage firm
> transfers ownership into **street name**, meaning the securities are
> now registered in the name of the broker-dealer. In street name
> ownership, the broker-dealer becomes the named, or **nominal owner**
> of the securities, but the customer is the **beneficial owner**,
> retaining all rights of ownership (e.g., voting rights and dividends).
> Street name allows for trading efficiency. Since the securities are
> held in the firm's name, customers can easily sell the securities
> without the burden of having to sign or endorse certificates.

###### Dividend Procedures

> As mentioned previously, dividends are distributions of a company's
> profits to shareholders. This section will explore procedures related
> to the dividend payment process.
>
> The **declaration date** is the date on which the board of directors
> declares that a dividend will be paid. At this time, the board
> specifies two other important dates: the record date and the payable
> date. The **record date** is the date upon which a stockholder must be
> a registered owner of the stock---a holder of record---to receive the
> dividend. The **payable date** is the date payment is actually made,
> generally about three weeks after the record date.
>
> Because issuing companies are required to notify the exchange on which
> the stock trades at least 10 business days prior to the record date
> for an upcoming dividend, the declaration date must be at least 10
> business days prior to the record date.
>
> Another important date in the dividend payment process is the
> **ex-dividend date**. The ex-dividend date governs who, upon the
> execution of a trade, will receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is
> established by the exchange, not the company's board of directors.
> This date is determined by the practice of **settlement**, which is
> when legal title passes from seller to buyer and the stock trade is
> complete. Most equity trades settle **regular way** T + 2, meaning two
> business days after the trade date.
>
> ***Example***
>
> If an investor purchases Apple stock on Monday, the trade will settle
> on Wednesday, two business days after the trade date. The settlement
> will be at the price of execution on Monday, but legal title will
> actually change hands on Wednesday.
>
> Because it takes two business days to settle a trade, the ex-dividend
> date is one business day prior to the record date. If a trade occurs
> before the ex-dividend date, the buyer receives the dividend because
> the trade will settle by the record date, and the buyer will be the
> holder of record. However, if the trade takes place on or after the
> ex-dividend date, the seller receives the dividend because settlement
> will take place after the record date. Described differently, in order
> for an investor to receive a dividend, a trade must settle on or prior
> to the record date. The following graphic illustrates this process.

>
> ***Example***
>
> If the record date is Friday, the stock goes ex-dividend on Thursday.
> Therefore, an individ- ual buying the stock on Wednesday will receive

> in a cash-settled transaction on the record date, because the trade
> settles that same day, the investor will receive the dividend. On the
> other hand, if an investor buys in a cash-settled transaction on the
> business day after the record date, the trade will still settle that
> same day, which is now after the record date, and too late to receive
> the dividend. Therefore, the ex-dividend date for cash settlement is
> the business day after the record date.
>
> The majority of transactions in equity securities settle regular way,
> rather than via cash settlement.

######### [Ex-Dividend Date and Price]{.underline} 

> On the morning of the ex-dividend date, the price of the stock drops
> by the amount of the dividend. This happens because a buyer will no
> longer receive the dividend upon purchasing the shares. Put
> differently, if an investor buys the stock on the ex-date, she will
> not receive the dividend, and therefore, she does not have to pay for
> it.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Verizon's stock is priced at \$50 per share. Its board of directors
> declares a \$0.60 dividend per share. On the ex-dividend date, the
> price of Verizon will decrease by \$0.60, to \$49.40.
>
> Additionally, any customer buy and sell orders that had been entered
> at or below the mar- ket are also reduced by the dividend on the
> morning of the ex-dividend date. These orders include **buy limit**,
> **sell stop**, and **sell stop limit** orders---all of which will be
> discussed in detail in later chapters.

######### Forms of Dividend Payment

> **Cash dividends**, the most common type of dividend, are dividends
> that are paid in cash. **Stock dividends** are paid in extra shares of
> stock instead of cash. Stock dividends are made pro rata to all
> shareholders; therefore, each shareholder's proportionate stake in the
> com- pany remains the same.
>
> ***Example***
>
> ABC Co. has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding. Joe owns 15 shares of
> ABC, equating to 1.5% of the company, calculated as 15/1,000. If ABC
> subsequently declares a 20% dividend, each investor will receive 20%
> more shares. Therefore, Joe will now receive three more shares (20% Ã
> 15 Shares) and will own a total of 18 shares. ABC will now have 20%
> more outstand- ing shares---for a total of 1,200. Joe's ownership
> remains 1.5%: 18 Shares/1,200 Shares.
>
> Sometimes, however, a company will distribute a stock of a different
> company as a dividend, such as the stock of a subsidiary. In rare, and
> typically dire, circumstances, a company could even pay a dividend in
> the form of company product.
>
> For the issuing company, the main advantage of a stock dividend is
> that its earnings can be reinvested for growth and development. The
> main advantage for the stockholder is that no taxes are paid on the
> stock dividend until the shares are sold. This contrasts with cash
> dividends, which are subject to taxation upon receipt by the investor.

######### Stock Splits and Dividends

> A **stock split** is an adjustment in an issuer's outstanding share
> count. After a stock split, each investor's ownership position remains
> unchanged, but the number of shares and the stock price are adjusted.
>
> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities
>
> A stock split in which the shareholder receives additional shares is
> called a **forward split**. **Forward stock splits** generally occur
> when a company believes its share price is too high to interest
> potential buyers. The perception is that if a stock exceeds a certain
> price, peo- ple will start looking for cheaper stocks. The issuing
> company counters this perception by splitting each share into
> multiple, lower-priced shares. For example, if a stock is trading at
>
> \$100 a share, after a 2-for-1 split, an investor will have two shares
> worth \$50 each. Note that there is no change in the total value of
> the position. Both before and after the split, the value of the
> investor's position is \$100.
>
> Technically, a forward stock split and a stock dividend are the same
> type of event. The share- holder receives additional shares, with each
> share proportionately worth a lesser price. The total value of shares
> remains about the same. For example, a 2-for-1 split is equal to a
> 100% stock dividend, and a 10% stock dividend is the same as an
> 11-for-10 stock split.
>
> ***Example***
>
> ABC stock splits 2-for-1. Instead of holding 100 shares at \$30, the
> investor has 200 shares at \$15. The total value of the position
> remains \$3,000 (200 Ã \$15).
>
> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities
>
> ***Example***
>
> ABC declares a 20% stock dividend, meaning that an investor will
> receive one new share for every five shares held. Instead of holding
> 100 shares at \$30, the investor now has 120 shares at \$25. The total
> value of the position remains \$3,000 (120 Ã \$25).
>
> ***Example***
>
> An investor owns 200 shares of stock, currently trading at \$24 per
> share. The company then executes a 5-for-4 split. After the split, the
> investor will own 250 shares, calculated as 200 Ã 5/4. The new stock
> price is \$19.20, calculated as \$24/5 Ã 4. Notice the value of the
> position is \$4,800 both before and after the split.
>
> A split in which the shareholder's share count is reduced is called a
> **reverse split**. A reverse split increases the price of the stock
> and converts each position into proportionately fewer shares. For
> example, in a 1-for-5 reverse split, five \$4 shares become one \$20
> share. Again, there is no change in value.
>
> Reverse splits are often deployed by issuers to avoid falling below
> the minimum price required for exchange listing (e.g., a minimum stock
> price of \$1 per share is required for continued exchange trading).
> For example, if a stock is trading at \$0.10 per share, the issuer
> might exe- cute a 1-for-50 reverse split to inflate the price of the
> stock to \$5 per share. Unfortunately for the issuer and its
> shareholders, it is not uncommon for the stock to return to the
> previous low price shortly after such a split.
>
> Anytime there is a reverse split, all open orders to trade the stock
> are cancelled.
>

###### Short Sales

> While the focus of this chapter has thus far been purchasing shares
> and owning a piece of the company, an alternative equity strategy that
> investors might use is **selling stock short** or **short sales**. In
> a short sale, an investor sells borrowed shares in the market, hoping
> to replace or "cover" the position at a lower price than the shares
> initially sold for. The differ- ence between what the investor sells
> for and what the investor pays to buy back the shares and return them
> to the lender is the profit or loss.
>
> *Chapter 1* Equity Securities
>
> Why do investors engage in short sales? The most basic answer is that
> they wish to speculate that the price of securities will fall.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Henry enters an order to **sell short** 300 shares of Citrix at a
> price of \$67, because he believes they are overvalued and due for a
> price decline. These shares are listed on his brokerage firm's
> easy-to-borrow list, so he knows he can borrow them from the firm.
> When he sells the shares, the sale proceeds of \$20,100 (300 Ã \$67)
> go into his account. Two months later, the shares have fallen to
> \$61.50. Henry enters an order to **buy to cover** 300 shares of
> Citrix at that price, paying \$18,450. In two months, he earns a
> profit of \$1,650 (\$20,100 â \$18,450).
>
> Had the shares appreciated in value, Henry would have faced a loss.
> Imagine that after two months, Citrix had appreciated to a price of
> \$75. Henry would have sold at \$67 and bought back at \$75, resulting
> in a loss of \$8 per share (\$2,400 overall). Put another way,
> regardless of how high the price of Citrix goes, Henry would have to
> purchase the shares in the market to return them to the lender.

1.  (**D**) Proxies are made available to help common stock shareholders
    exercise their right

> to elect the board of directors. Think of a proxy as an absentee
> ballot. It is not necessary to delegate another person to cast the
> proxy vote because proxies are counted directly, the same as in-person
> votes. Many companies allow proxies to be cast online, in addition to
> by mail.

2.  (**D**) Street name registration means that shares are held in the
    name of the broker-dealer at which the customer holds their account.
    This facilitates trading of the shares.

> However, the shareholder does not lose any rights of ownership, such
> as voting rights.

3.  (**A**) Common stockholders stand behind all other holders of a
    company's securities in the line to receive any remaining assets. In
    many cases, this means common stockholders will be completely wiped
    out by a bankruptcy or liquidation. It is perhaps the most
    significant risk of owning common stock, compared to owning other
    forms of corporate securities.

4.  (**B**) Common stock dividends are generally declared by the board
    of directors and paid quarterly. However, they are not guaranteed
    and can decline or be totally eliminated if the company falls on
    hard times.

5.  (**C**) Through a rights offering, companies give existing
    shareholders the right to acquire newly issued shares proportionate
    to their current holdings, so as to maintain their proportionate
    (percentage) interest. This is called the pre-emptive right or the
    subscription right. Each shareholder has the option of exercising
    the right.

6.  (**D**) Rights and warrants are equity securities that trade in the
    secondary market, independent from the underlying stock. They can
    generally be sold at any time to anyone.

7.  (**C**) Regardless of how poorly a company performs, a common stock
    investor has limited liability and can only lose the full amount
    invested. Common stock investors can't be held liable for a
    company's debts or legal obligations, beyond the amount they have
    personally invested.

8.  (**A**) An advantage of owning preferred stock is the predictable
    dividend, which is always expressed as a percentage of par value. In
    this case, an 8% annual dividend calculated on a \$5 par value
    produces 40 cents' worth of dividend income per share per year.

9.  (**D**) Convertible preferred gives investors the option to exchange
    the preferred stock into shares of the issuer's common stock based
    on a defined ratio. Therefore, convertible preferred shares can
    capture the upside potential of the underlying common stock. The
    price of these preferred issues also fluctuates with the value of
    the common stock.

10. (**B**) A negotiable security is one that can be freely transferred,
    assigned, or delivered. For example, most listed equities are
    negotiable. Note that not all securities are negotiable.

#### Unit Exam---Solutions (Continued) {#unit-examsolutions-continued .unnumbered}

11. (**A**) The transfer agent records changes of ownership on the books
    of the issuer and maintains records of investors' share ownership.

12. (**B**) The dividend is announced by the board of directors on the
    declaration date. It is then paid on the payable date to
    shareholders of record on the record date. New investors must buy
    the stock before the ex-dividend date to be shareholders of record
    on the record date. Remember that the books are locked in, for
    dividend-payment purposes, on the record date.

13. (**B**) The ex-dividend date is normally one day before the record
    date. This reflects the fact that most stocks trade regular way, T +
    2---i.e., ownership changes two business days after the trade date.
    To be a shareholder of record on the record date, an investor must
    buy at least two days prior, on or before March 6. March 7 is the
    ex-dividend date, the first day on which the stock trades without a
    dividend right. Remember: Buy on ex-div date, too late.

14. (**B**) Investors sell shares of a stock short mainly to profit from
    a decline in the share price, or to protect against an adverse event
    affecting the stock or company.

15. (**B**) ADRs represent units of ownership in foreign securities, but
    they are traded in the

> US, in US dollars. They have all the benefits of buying the foreign
> stock directly, without the inconvenience of having to understand
> foreign markets or convert currencies.

16. (**C**) Non-systematic risk, or business risk, is encountered when
    buying individual stocks. It's the exposure to negative events that
    impact a specific company or stock, not the market or sector as a
    whole. This type of risk can be mitigated by diversifying a
    portfolio.

### Debt Securities

> As an alternative to issuing stock to raise capital, issuers can also
> sell **bonds**. Unlike stock, bonds and fixed-income securities
> represent a loan to a borrower, not equity. This chapter will discuss
> the general characteristics of debt securities, the different yields
> used to value bonds, and risks associated with bond ownership.

####### Chapter Goals {#chapter-goals-1 .unnumbered}

-   Understand the basic characteristics of debt securities.

-   Describe the relationship between interest rates and bond prices.

-   Be able to make conclusions about whether bonds are trading at a
    premium or at a discount based on the relationship between the
    different yields.

-   Define the risks associated with bonds.

-   Understand accrued interest.

####### Key Terms {#key-terms-1 .unnumbered}

-   **Bond**---A security issued by a corporation or governmental entity
    to raise capital, representing a loan to a borrower in return for
    payment of interest and principal to the lender

-   **Refunding**---The process by which an issuer refinances, selling
    cheaper bonds to replace callable outstanding bonds in an
    environment in which interest rates are declining

-   **Yield to maturity (YTM)**---The most widely quoted rate of return
    on a bond, accounting for not only the interest payments received by
    the investor, but also the difference between their purchase price
    and the amount of principal received at maturity

-   **Interest rate risk**---The risk that as interest rates increase,
    bond prices will decrease

-   **Accrued interest**---The interest that is paid by the buyer of a
    bond to the seller when a bond is traded between coupon payment
    dates

> *Chapter 2* Debt Securities

######  General Characteristics of Bonds

> Bond issuers engage in **debt financing**, as they are borrowing money
> from investors. When buying bonds, investors are promised a return of
> their money (the principal), along with interest. As **creditors** of
> the issuer, bondholders have a higher claim on assets than share-
> holders in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation. Bonds and other
> securities that pay a regular income stream to investors are referred
> to as **fixed-income securities**.
>
> Bonds are issued by corporations, governments, and municipalities.
> Regardless of who the issuer is, all bonds share a number of
> characteristics.

######### [Forms of Ownership]{.underline} 

> Until 1983, bonds were commonly issued in **bearer form**. **Bearer
> bonds** included physical certificates and interest coupons. For
> interest on the bond to be paid, a **coupon** had to be clipped and
> presented to a paying agent of the issuer---typically any bank. The
> issuer kept no record of ownership. Payment of interest and ultimately
> principal was made to whomever had possession of the bond and coupons.
> A picture of a bearer bond with attached coupons is below.
>
> ![](media/image5.png)
>
> Although these bonds are no longer issued, a small number still trade
> in the secondary mar- ket between investors. When bearer bonds are
> sold, the holder must make physical delivery of the bond certificate.
>
> Bonds today are issued in **registered form** instead of bearer form.
> This means that the name of the owner(s) of the bond is recorded with
> the issuer or a transfer agent. With **fully registered bonds**, as
> they are called, there is no need for the bondholder to clip coupons
> to receive interest; the interest is automatically sent to the owner.
>
> A fully registered bond may include an engraved physical certificate,
> but there are no cou- pons on the certificate.
>
> Now, **book-entry form** is the most common method of tracking
> ownership. In this format, the investor's ownership is recorded
> electronically by a central depository, replacing physical transfer.
> When a change of ownership occurs, the depository changes its records
> and pro- vides a receipt or confirmation for the transaction. The
> difference between book-entry and
>
> fully registered bonds is that for book-entry, ownership is recorded
> by a central depository rather than by the issuer.
>
> Registered and **book-entry bonds** are both convenient and safe for
> bondholders. They are protected from loss or theft, and bondholders
> receive automatic payment of principal and interest.

######### Par Value

> **Par value**, also known as **face value** or **principal**, is the
> amount of money a bondholder will receive at maturity. Bonds normally
> have a par value of \$1,000. A newly issued bond usually sells at a
> price close to par.
>
> When issuers sell bonds, they are usually raising thousands, millions,
> or billions of dollars. For example, if an issuer is selling \$10
> million in bonds, this means the par value of all the bonds being sold
> is an aggregate of \$10 million.

######### Bond Quotation

> Par value is not the same as the market price of the bond. **Market
> price**, or the price of the bond paid by investors in secondary
> trading, fluctuates in response to a number of factors, primarily
> changing interest rates.
>
> A **bond quotation** states the price at which a bond is trading. Bond
> quotes are typically expressed as a percentage of their par value,
> with the percentage converted to a point scale. A bond that is trading
> at par value is said to be trading at 100, which is 100% of its par
> value, or \$1,000.

-   A bond quote above 100 means the bond is trading at a premium to
    par. For example, a bond quoted at 105 is trading at 105% of par, or
    \$1,050.

-   A bond quote below 100 means the bond is trading at a discount to
    par. For example, a bond quoted at 95 is trading at 95% of par, or
    \$950.

######### [Coupon]{.underline} 

> The **coupon** is the payment bondholders receive as interest.
> Essentially, it is the investor's compensation for lending money to
> the issuer.
>
> The term "coupon" is carried over from the days when physical coupons
> were attached to bond certificates. As discussed above, interest
> payments are now typically mailed to bond- holders or paid into a
> brokerage account.
>
> The coupon rate of interest, also referred to as the **nominal yield
> (NY)**, is expressed as a percentage of par value. Most bonds pay
> interest to investors every six months in two semi- annual
> installments. For example, a bond that pays a coupon of 10% pays 10%
> of \$1,000 (par value) or \$100 of interest per year. An investor who
> owns the bond receives \$50 semiannually, as well as at maturity.
>
> Because interest is paid every six months, it can be paid:

-   January and July ( J&J)

-   February and August (F&A)

-   March and September (M&S)

-   April and October (A&O)

-   May and November (M&N)

-   June and December ( J&D)

> The coupon is typically paid on the 1st of the month. However, if the
> number 15 is listed after the months, interest is paid on the 15th of
> the month instead of on the 1st. For example, "J&J 15" would indicate
> interest is paid on January 15th and July 15th.

>
> If a bond is issued with a coupon rate that remains the same until
> maturity, it is called a **fixed-rate bond**. However, not all bonds
> are issued with fixed coupons. Issuers sometimes choose to offer bonds
> that pay a variable rate of return. These instruments are called
> **float- ing-rate bonds**, **adjustable-rate bonds**, or
> **variable-rate bonds**. As the name of the bond implies, the rate
> that the issuer pays to bondholders varies based on a specific
> benchmark, such as the Treasury Bill rate. For example, as the T-Bill
> rate increases or decreases, so will the coupon rate.

######### [Zero-Coupon Bonds]{.underline} 

> **Zero-coupon bonds** pay no interest during the life of the bond.
> Instead, investors buy zero-coupon bonds at a deep discount from par
> value. The difference between the dis- counted price and the maturity
> value is the interest the investor receives from the bond. Investors
> are able to buy the bond at a discounted price but receive the full
> amount of face value at maturity.
>
> Zero-coupon bonds are usually long term with maturities of 10 or more
> years. Because of this structure, zero-coupon bonds are useful to
> investors planning for a long-range goal, such as retirement or a
> child's college education. When saving for retirement or tuition
> payments, interim coupon payments are not important.
>
> *Chapter 2* Debt Securities
>
> ***Example***
>
> Susan purchases a zero-coupon bond maturing in 15 years. She buys the
> bond for \$700, and at maturity she will receive the face amount of
> \$1,000. The \$300 difference reflects Susan's return.
>
> Because zero-coupon bonds pay no interest until maturity, their prices
> fluctuate more than those of other types of bonds in the secondary
> market. In addition, although no interest payments are made until
> maturity, investors may still have to pay federal, state, and local
> income tax on the **imputed interest**, or **phantom interest**, that
> accrues each year.

######### [Bond Pricing]{.underline} 

> Interest rates are the major driver of bond prices. The relationship
> between rates and prices is inverse: as rates rise, outstanding bond
> prices fall. As rates fall, outstanding bond prices rise. For example,
> if an investor holds a bond that was issued with a coupon of 5%, and
> inter- est rates in the market have gone up such that similar bonds
> are coming to market at 6%, the existing 5% bond's price will fall
> because the newly issued bonds will pay a higher coupon.
>
> Why is this the case? Consider an investor with \$1,000 to invest.
> This investor could buy an existing bond that pays 5% (\$50 per year)
> or a new bond that pays 6% (\$60 per year). The investor will prefer
> the new, 6% bond. Therefore, the investor stuck with the 5% bond will
> need to lower the price to make it more marketable.
>
> However, if interest rates fall so that similar bonds are coming to
> market at 3.5%, the 5%-cou- pon bond becomes more valuable. The price
> of the 5% bond will rise, as investors will pay a premium to earn that
> higher coupon. This relationship is a basic concept that applies to
> all fixed-rate investments. As a reminder, this also applies to
> preferred stock, which, as dis- cussed in the prior chapter, trades
> more like bonds than stock due to its regular dividend.

######### [Basis Points]{.underline} 

> A **basis point (bps)** is a unit of measure that equals one
> one-hundredth of a percentage point (0.01%). There are 100 bps
> (pronounced "bips") in one percentage point (100 bps = 1%).
>
> Securities professionals use basis points to discuss small changes in
> bond interest rates, e.g., a tenth of a percent (10 bps) or half a
> percent (50 bps). For example, if the yield on a bond increases from
> 0.75% to 0.85%, the yield can be described as having moved by 10 bps,

######### [Maturity]{.underline} 

> The **maturity date** is the future date on which principal is
> returned to bondholders. Maturities can range from as short as one day
> to as long as 30 years. The bond's maturity is specified at issue.
>
> A bond that matures in one year is much more predictable than a bond
> that matures in 30 years. Due to greater uncertainty over the long
> term, long-term bonds generally pay more interest than short-term
> bonds. It is also generally true that a long-term bond will fluctuate
> in price more than a short-term bond as interest rates change.

> ***[2.1.8.1 Sinking Fund]{.underline}***
>
> Bond issues with longer maturities may have a **sinking fund
> provision** so that the issuer is prepared for the future redemption.
> The issuer must regularly set aside money in a special account called
> a **sinking fund** for the redemption of bonds before maturity. To do
> this, issu- ers establish an **escrow account** (which is an account
> held by a third party in safekeeping), typically with a bank. This
> ensures that the issuer has the necessary funds at maturity. A sinking
> fund enhances the safety and liquidity of the issue.

######### [Call Feature]{.underline} 

> A bond is **callable** if the issuer has the right to redeem it prior
> to its maturity date. Issuers must clearly state the inclusion of a
> **call feature** at the time of issue, and disclose when they might
> redeem it and at what price. When a bond is called, interest payments
> will cease.
>
> In most cases, an issuer will pay investors a **call premium**, which
> is an amount above par that compensates investors for the early
> redemption. Typically, the earlier the call, the higher the premium.
> The amount of the call premium is in the offering documents.
>
> ***Example***
>
> If a bond is called after five years, the issuer might pay \$1,050 to
> redeem the bond (a \$50 premium). However, if the bond is called after
> 10 years, the issuer might only pay \$1,025 to redeem the bond (a \$25
> premium).
>
> A company is likely to call a bond if it is paying a higher coupon
> than current market inter- est rates. The company can then issue new
> bonds at a lower interest rate, saving money on the coupon payments.
> The process of calling bonds when interest rates have fallen is called
> **refunding**, and it is similar to a homeowner refinancing a home
> mortgage to make lower monthly payments.
>
> ***Example***
>
> ABC Co. has 6% callable bonds outstanding. Due to a change in market
> conditions, ABC's underwriters advise that new bonds could be sold at
> a 4% rate. Therefore, by refunding and issuing new debt, ABC can save
> the difference of 2% annually.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Dave owns a \$1,000 par value, 6% bond, callable at 102. If the bond
> is called, the issuer will pay Dave \$1,050, i.e., \$1,000 Par + \$30
> Final Semiannual Coupon Payment + \$20 Call Premium.
>
> Because this feature is attractive to the borrower (i.e., the issuer),
> but not so great for the bondholder, who will lose the higher rate of
> interest the bond is paying, callable bonds are riskier than
> non-callable bonds. Therefore, callable bonds will generally pay a
> higher rate than non-callable bonds.
>
> *Chapter 2* Debt Securities
>
> Some bonds can be sold with **call protection**, defined as a period
> of time from the date of issue during which the bond cannot be called.
> These provisions are set by the issuer and vary based on the market
> conditions at the time of issuance.
>
> Most corporate and municipal bonds with maturities of over 10 years
> are callable. Bonds issued by the federal government are not callable.
>
> ***[2.1.9.1 Puttable Bonds]{.underline}***
>
> Some bonds include a **put feature**, giving investors the right to
> demand early repayment of principal if some predetermined event
> occurs, thus protecting investors. For example, if the bond rating
> falls or interest rates increase above a certain level, the investor
> has the right to sell back the bond to the issuer. The put option is
> generally exercisable on one or more dates, as specified in the
> contract of the bond.
>
> Because puttable bonds are beneficial to investors, they pay less
> interest than similar straight or non-puttable bonds.

#### Progress Check---Solutions {#progress-checksolutions-1 .unnumbered}

1.  (**A**) Interest rate risk is one of the main vulnerabilities of
    bonds. The relationship between bond prices and interest rates is
    *inverse*. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall.
    This is true for virtually all fixed-coupon bonds, but not for
    adjustable-rate bonds.

2.  (**C**) Bond owners lend money to the company in exchange for
    interest payments and a return of principal. It is much like making
    any other type of loan, except that bond loans can be freely traded.

3.  (**B**) Nominal yield or coupon yield is locked in at the bond's
    issuance and does not change. It is the total annual interest
    payable divided by par value, which is normally \$1,000 per bond. In
    this case, the nominal yield is \$50 of interest per year divided by
    \$1,000 par value.

4.  (**D**) Most bonds pay interest twice per year, at six-month
    intervals. In this case, the months of payment (M&S) are March and
    September. Most interest payments are made on the first day of the
    month. However, a marking of **15** indicates payment will be made
    on the 15th.

5.  (**C**) At maturity, the bondholder receives par value plus the
    final coupon interest payment. Each semiannual coupon payment is
    \$30, and two such payments per year create the 6% yield.

> \$1,000 Par Value + \$30 Interest per Bond. \$1,030 Ã 8 Bonds =
> \$8,240.

6.  (**C**) Zero-coupon bonds do pay interest, but it is only paid at
    maturity, as the difference between the original discounted issue
    price and the maturity (par) value. For example, if a zero bond is
    issued at \$600 and matures at \$1,000, the interest is \$400.
    Although interest is not paid until maturity, it is generally taxed
    annually.

7.  (**C**) The registered/book-entry form has made bond investing more
    secure, more efficient, and much simpler for bond investors. In
    registered form, the record of ownership is kept by a transfer
    agent. There is no need for the bondholder to clip coupons to
    receive interest, and there is no danger of losing a paper bond
    certificate.

8.  (**B**) Yields and interest rates are expressed in basis points
    (bps, bips), and 100 bps = 1%. A change of 20 bps is 0.20%.

######  Bond Yields

> A bond's **yield** refers to the return an investor will receive from
> the investment. As discussed, the **coupon**, or **nominal yield**, is
> the stated rate that the issuer promises to pay each interest payment
> period. The coupon rate is usually fixed over the life of the bond.
>
> However, other factors can influence investor returns over time. Bonds
> may trade in the market at a premium or at a discount to their par
> value. Issuers may call bonds prior to their maturity and interrupt
> the stream of interest payments. An investor's actual yield or return
> is impacted by these events.
>
> It is important to know how to compute certain yields and to
> understand the relationship between the yield quotations and bond
> prices. Once investors comprehend yield, they can better compare
> different investments.

######### Nominal Yield

> A bond's **nominal yield (NY)** is always equal to its coupon. To say
> a bond pays a 5% coupon is the same as saying the bond has a nominal
> yield of 5%. The nominal yield is fixed and does not change over the
> life of the bond.
>
> ***Example***
>
> An investor purchases a bond with a 9% nominal yield from DEF Co.
> Every year, DEF will pay the investor \$90 of annual interest in two
> semiannual installments. This is fixed over the life of the bond.

######### Current Yield

> A bond's **current yield (CY)** is calculated as the annual interest
> payment divided by the cur- rent price. This represents a bond's
> return based on its current market price, rather than its par value.
> The formula for the calculation of current yield is below:

+------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

> Assume a bond is issued with a 5% coupon. If the bond is trading at
> par (i.e., \$1,000, or 100% of par), its current yield is equal to its
> coupon, as shown below.

+-------------------------+-------+--------------------+--------------+

> If the same bond is trading at 120 (or 120% of par, \$1,200), its
> current yield will fall based on the inverse relationship between
> price and yield. This calculation is shown below.

+------------------------+-------+-------------------+----------------+

+------------------------+-------+-------------------+----------------+

> Finally, if the same bond is trading at 80 (or 80% of par, \$800), its
> current yield will rise because its price has fallen.

+-------------------------+-------+-----------------+----------------+

> *Chapter 2* Debt Securities

######### [Yield to Maturity]{.underline} 

> The yield calculation that includes the gain or loss if the bond is
> held to maturity is the **yield to maturity (YTM)**. YTM is the most
> widely quoted yield for bonds. It takes into account the current

> Because YTM is calculated using a specialized calculator, you will not
> be asked to calculate it on the exam.

######### [Yield to Call]{.underline} 

> If a bond is callable, **yield to call (YTC)** becomes the more
> important yield calculation. It determines the investor's yield if the
> bond is called on the first possible call date rather than held until

###### Bond Risks

> Like other types of securities, bonds have various risk factors, which
> investors must thor- oughly comprehend before making an investment. A
> risk/return tradeoff exists when invest- ing in debt instruments. This
> section will describe the key risks that bond investors face.

######### [Interest Rate Risk]{.underline} 

> **Interest rate risk** is the risk that an investment's value will
> change as a result of a change in interest rates. This risk affects
> the value of bonds more directly than the value of stocks. When
> interest rates rise, bond prices fall; conversely, when interest rates
> fall, bond prices rise. This is known as the **inverse relationship**
> between price and yield.
>
> In general, a bond with a longer maturity and a lower (or zero) coupon
> will have greater interest rate risk for the investor.

######### Call Risk

> **Call risk** is the risk that a bond may be redeemed by an issuer
> when interest rates are fall- ing. Again, certain bonds are issued
> with a call feature that allows the issuer to buy back its bonds in
> order to re-issue new bonds at a lower interest rate. This reduces the
> issuer's interest expense, but investors lose their relatively high
> rate of interest.

######### Reinvestment Rate Risk

> Call risk leads to **reinvestment rate risk** (or simply
> **reinvestment risk**), which is the risk that no available
> investments will be able to provide a similar return as a bond that
> has been called.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Gene purchases a long-term, 8% corporate bond. The Fed announces that
> it is lowering interest rates. Gene now faces reinvestment rate risk
> on the periodic interest payments because he must reinvest the \$80 he
> earns each year at a lower rate of return.

######### [Inflationary Risk]{.underline} 

> **Inflationary risk**, or **purchasing power risk**, is the risk that
> an investment's returns will be adversely impacted because of
> inflation. **Inflation** is the general increase in the price of goods
> and services over time, and is measured by the **Consumer Price Index
> (CPI)**. The CPI estimates the average price of consumer goods and
> services purchased by households.
>
> It measures a price change for these goods and services from one
> period to the next within a given area (city, region, or nation).
>
> Products that deliver a fixed rate of return, such as bonds or
> preferred stock, are susceptible to inflationary risk because their
> interest payments (or preferred dividends) remain constant while the
> cost of goods and services continues to rise.
>
> Consider an investor who owns a 10% bond with a 10-year maturity. The
> bond will produce interest income of \$100 each year, but in
> inflationary environments, that \$100 buys fewer real goods and
> services each year. Put more plainly, \$100 will buy less food,
> gasoline, and other services each year. At the bond's maturity in 10
> years, the return of the \$1,000 par principal will also have reduced
> purchasing power. In a deflationary environment, however, the pur-
> chasing power of a fixed-income investment increases.
>
> Additionally, during times of very high inflation, the Federal Reserve
> Board might look to raise interest rates in order to curb inflation
> and tighten the money supply. This inter- est rate increase causes
> bond prices to decrease---another negative result of inflation for
> bondholders.

######### [Credit Risk]{.underline} 

> The degree of risk associated with the issuer's ability to make
> interest payments or repay the principal is the **default**, or
> **credit risk**, of the bond. To attract investors, issuers that are
> less creditworthy (i.e., those with higher credit or default risk)
> must issue bonds with higher interest rates than issuers that are more
> creditworthy.
>
> *Chapter 2* Debt Securities
>
> ***[2.3.5.1 Credit Ratings]{.underline}***
>
> Bond rating services publish **credit ratings** to inform investors of
> bonds' credit quality. Bonds rated as **investment grade** have a
> lower chance of default and a corresponding lower yield.
> Non-investment-grade bonds have a higher chance of default (more
> credit risk) and a higher yield. Non-investment-grade bonds are also
> called **junk bonds** or **high-yield bonds**.
>
> Government bonds, especially those issued by the US federal
> government, have the lowest default risk and the lowest returns, while
> corporate bonds have greater credit risk but pay more interest.
>
> The ratings of the three major nationally recognized statistical
> ratings organizations are detailed below with AAA being the highest
> rating of creditworthiness.

###### Accrued Interest

> One of the advantages of owning a bond is the right to receive
> interest from the issuer on a regular basis. If a bond is sold in
> between interest payment dates, some of the interest belongs to the
> seller, and some belongs to the buyer. The calculation of **accrued
> interest** determines the amount of interest that goes to each party.
>
> To calculate the amount of accrued interest, several rules must be
> followed:

-   For corporate, municipal, and agency bonds, a year is assumed to
    > have 360 days, with 30 days in each month. Regular way settlement
    > is T + 2, which is two business days after the trade date.

-   For T-notes and T-bonds, a year is assumed to have 365 days, with
    actual-day months. US government securities settle regular way on
    the next business day following the trade, or T + 1.

-   For corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and Treasuries, cash
    settlement is the same day as the trade date.

> ![](media/image6.png)![](media/image7.png)The number of days of
> accrued interest is calculated beginning on the last coupon date,
> including that date and up to, but not including, the settlement date.
> The image below illustrates the accrued interest process for a

###### Accretion and Amortization

> When an investor buys a bond for a discount or premium, the Internal
> Revenue Service (IRS) requires investors to adjust the cost basis of
> the bond toward par value each year. **Cost basis** represents the
> value of an asset for tax purposes. If the asset is later sold for a
> profit, the difference between the cost basis and sales proceeds
> reflects the investor's capital gain, which they must pay taxes on.
>
> Specifically, when a bond is purchased for a discount, the cost basis
> must be accreted. **Accretion** means that the cost basis of the bond
> must be adjusted upward toward par each year so that at maturity the
> investor's cost basis will equal par of \$1,000.
>
> Bonds are accreted on a straight-line basis. To calculate the annual
> accretion, divide the discount off par by the number of years until
> maturity.
>
> *Chapter 2* Debt Securities
>
> ***Example***
>
> John buys a bond for \$900 with 10 years until maturity. The annual
> accretion is calculated as the \$100 discount off par divided by 10
> years to maturity, which equals \$10. Therefore, the cost basis of the
> bond will be adjusted upward by \$10 each year. For example, after one
> year of holding the bond, the new cost basis will be \$910.
>
> When a bond is purchased for a premium, the cost basis must be
> amortized. **Amortization** means that the cost basis will be adjusted
> downward each year so that at maturity the investor's cost basis will
> equal par of \$1,000. Premium bonds are also amortized using the
> straight-line method.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Jane buys a bond for \$1,100 with five years until maturity. The
> annual adjustment is calcu- lated as the \$100 premium divided by five
> years to maturity, which equals \$20. Therefore, the cost basis of the
> bond will be adjusted downward by \$20 each year. For example, after
> one year of holding the bond, the new cost basis will be \$1,080.
>
> Because accretion and amortization impact the investor's cost basis,
> it will help to deter- mine the taxable gain or loss on a bond if the
> bond is sold by the investor prior to maturity.

| 1.  True---A bond investor can generally expect to receive interest   |
|     > payments twice per year, six months apart, on the first day of  |
|     > the month. **For example, a bond might pay interest on the      |
|     > first day of January and then again on the first day of July. A |
|     > small percentage of bonds pay interest on the 15th of the       |

| 2.  False---Zero-coupon bonds have no coupons, and the investor does  |
|     > not receive any interest. **Zero-coupon bonds do pay interest   |

| 3.  False---Zero-coupon bonds are considered too risky to be used for |

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-1 .unnumbered}

1.  (**D**) For the same issuer, longer maturities usually pay higher
    yields. This is due to the uncertainty of longer bond-holding
    periods, and also to the increased interest rate risk of
    long-maturity bonds, if interest rates rise.

2.  (**C**) Interest rates of floating-rate (adjustable-rate,
    variable-rate) bonds are determined by the level of a popular bond
    index or benchmark, such as Treasury bills. For example, the rate
    may be Treasury bills + 2%. The advantage of these bonds is that
    they have little or no interest rate risk---i.e., they don't decline
    in market value if rates rise.

3.  (**B**) Current yield is calculated by dividing annual interest
    payable by the current market price of the bond. In this case \$80
    annual interest divided by the current market price of \$980. Do
    *not* use the original purchase price.

4.  (**A**) A bond is callable if the issuer has a right to redeem it
    prior to maturity. These bonds are said to have a call feature.
    Typically, the issuer pays a price above par, a call premium, to
    retire bonds prior to maturity.

5.  (**D**) It often benefits the issuer to call a bond when interest
    rates are declining. The issuer can then refinance by selling new
    bonds at a lower interest rate---i.e., a lower cost to borrow money
    from investors. For investors, having to reinvest returned principal
    in a low-rate environment is a vulnerability of callable bonds.

6.  (**A**) A put feature gives the *investor* the option to retire
    bonds early, just as a call feature gives the issuer this option.
    Put features can be attractive to investors, especially in
    rising-rate environments. Investors can demand repayment early and
    reinvest in higher-yielding bonds.

7.  (**D**) A sinking fund provision requires the issuer to regularly
    set aside money for redeeming bonds. The money is held in escrow by
    a third party, which ensures that the issuer has sufficient funds to
    retire bonds at maturity.

8.  (**A**) Nominal yield is set at the time a bond is issued and does
    not change. The calculation uses par value, a constant, as the
    denominator. The numerator is annual interest payable, also a
    constant.

9.  (**A**) Current yield is calculated by dividing annual interest
    payable by the current market price of the bond. If market price
    declines, current yield increases. This increase in yield then makes
    the bond relatively more attractive, which could attract more bids
    and boost the price.

10. (**B**) If current yield is *below* nominal yield, the bond is
    selling at a premium. If the reverse is true, it is selling at a
    discount.

11. (**A**) Remember that it is always the *first call date* (plus any
    call premium on that date) that is used in the YTC calculation.

12. (**A**) Nominal yield is lowest because it is the only measure that
    doesn't include the capital

> *Chapter 2:* Debt Securities

#### Unit Exam---Solutions (Continued) {#unit-examsolutions-continued-1 .unnumbered}

> gains realized by holding the bond to maturity or call. The capital
> gains are produced as the bond approaches maturity and the discount
> gradually disappears.

13. (**B**) Zero-coupon bonds are deeply discounted because the discount
    must include all interest accruing in the bond. Technically, zeros
    do not have either a nominal or current yield, because they pay no
    current interest. (The numerator is zero.) The only

> meaningful yield quote for a zero is YTM.

14. (**C**) Long-term, low-coupon bonds (including zeros) are the most
    susceptible to changing interest rates. Therefore, as interest rates
    fall, the price of the 30-year, zero-coupon bond will appreciate the
    most.

15. (**D**) Reinvestment risk is the risk that as interest rates fall,
    the semiannual coupon payments an investor receives will be
    reinvested at a lower rate. Because zero-coupon bonds have no
    coupons to reinvest, they have no reinvestment risk.

16. (**A**) Triple-B (BBB) is S&P's lowest investment-grade-bond rating.
    For Moody's, the comparable rating is Baa. Bonds rated below these
    categories are considered non- investment grade or junk bonds.

> previous chapter---interest, yield, pricing, and risk. Thousands of
> issuers sell bonds, including corporations, govern- ments,
> broker-dealers, and municipalities. Bonds can be purchased as
> individual products or in a packaged vehicle. This unit will review

####### Key Terms {#key-terms-2 .unnumbered}

-   **Convertible bonds**---A corporate bond that can be converted at
    the investor's choice into a fixed number of common shares of the
    company

-   **Parity price**---The market value at which an investor is
    indifferent toward owning a convertible bond or converting into the
    underlying common stock

-   **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)**---Pools of mortgages that are
    turned into bonds, helping to create more liquidity in the mortgage
    market

-   **Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)**---Mortgage-backed
    securities that are structured by broker-dealers and divided into
    tranches, each varying by expected maturity, credit quality, and
    exposure to investment risks

-   **General obligation (GO) bonds**---Municipal bonds issued to
    finance a non- revenue-producing facility (e.g., public park, public
    school, or public library) and backed by the taxing power of the
    issuing municipality

-   **Revenue bonds**---Municipal bonds issued for and backed by a
    revenue-producing facility (e.g., a toll road, an airport, or a
    water treatment facility)

-   **Money market securities**---Very safe and liquid debt securities
    with maturities of one year or less, including Treasury bills,
    negotiable certificates of deposit, and commercial paper

######  Corporate Bonds

> **Corporate bonds** are issued by commercial and industrial entities
> to raise money for expansion. The term usually applies to longer-term
> debt instruments with maturities of at least 10 years. **Notes** are
> medium-term maturity instruments, and **commercial paper** is the name
> often used for corporate instruments with a maturity of no more than
> 270 days.
>
> The vast majority of trading volume in corporate bonds takes place in
> the over-the-counter marketplace.
>
> The tax consequences of owning bonds differ by the bond issuer. While
> certain exemptions apply to interest paid by government and municipal
> issuers, interest paid on corporate bonds is fully taxable as ordinary
> income at the federal, state, and local levels.

######### Trust Indenture Act of 1939

> The **Trust Indenture Act of 1939** requires that corporate debt
> issues of more than \$50 million include a written agreement, or
> **trust indenture**, between the issuer and an inde- pendent trustee
> acting on behalf of the bondholders. The indenture includes a number
> of protective **covenants**, or promises by the issuer, that are

-   Submit SEC filings

-   Pay taxes

-   No selling of key assets

-   Maintain insurance

-   Maintain a certain credit profile

> The **trustee**, which is typically a large bank, is legally empowered

######### Secured and Unsecured Corporate Bonds

> Debt securities may be backed by collateral or may be unsecured and
> backed only by the "good faith" of the corporation.
>
> ***[3.1.2.1 Secured Debt]{.underline}***
>
> **Secured corporate debt** is backed by corporate collateral, and
> investors have rights to the collateral if the issuer defaults on
> principal and interest payments.

-   **Mortgage bonds** are corporate bonds that are secured by real
    estate holdings or other real property.

-   **Collateral trust bonds** are secured by a financial asset owned by
    the corporation, such as stocks, bonds, or other securities.

-   **Equipment trust obligations** are debt instruments that are
    secured by equipment or physical assets such as airplanes, trucks,
    and trains.

> ***[3.1.2.2 Unsecured Debt]{.underline}***
>
> **Unsecured corporate debt**, also called **debentures**, pays more
> interest than secured debt because it is not backed by a specific
> asset; thus this category of debt is perceived to have greater credit
> risk.
>
> *Chapter 3*

######## Types of Bonds {#types-of-bonds-1 .unnumbered}

> Some unsecured debt may be contractually identified as senior to other
> unsecured debt, giving it higher priority in a corporate liquidation.
> The more junior debt is called **subordi- nated debt**, and its
> holders have a lower priority in case of a bankruptcy filing. As a
> result, subordinated debt pays more interest to investors.
>
> ***[3.1.2.3 Liquidation Priority]{.underline}***
>
> If a corporation goes bankrupt, creditors are repaid according to a
> priority schedule set forth in the Bankruptcy Code. Each creditor
> class will be paid in full before the next class receives a
> distribution. This waterfall continues until there are no assets left
> to distribute. The **liquidation priority** is set forth below:

-   Secured bondholders

-   Unsecured bondholders and general creditors

-   Subordinated debt and convertible bonds

-   Preferred stockholders

-   Common stockholders

> As a general matter, securities with a lower priority will have a
> higher expected return due to the greater risk. The table below
> illustrates the tradeoff between risk and return in the corporate
> structure.

######### [Convertible Bonds]{.underline} 

> A **convertible bond** offers an investor the option of converting the
> bond into common stock (equity) of the issuer. The terms under which
> this exchange can occur are detailed in the bond indenture. Because of
> this added feature, convertible bonds yield less interest than
> nonconvertible bonds from the same issuer.
>
> Convertible securities tend to be offered by issuers as a means to
> achieve lower fixed costs for borrowing. Also, through the issuance of
> convertible debt rather than equity, issuers avoid immediate dilution
> of their common shares.

> *Chapter 3*

######## Types of Bonds {#types-of-bonds-2 .unnumbered}

> From an investor's perspective, though convertible bonds are a safer
> investment than com- mon stock, they can provide stock-like returns.
> They are less volatile than stocks, and their value can only fall to a
> price where the yield would be equal to that of a nonconvertible bond
> with the same terms.
>
> ***[3.1.3.1 Convertible Bond Calculations]{.underline}***
>
> Upon issuance, a convertible bond has a stated price at which the
> bondholder is able to convert to shares of common stock. This price is
> called the **conversion price**.
>
> The number of common shares that the bondholder will receive upon
> conversion is called the **conversion ratio**. It is always based on
> par value of the convertible security, regardless of the bond's
> current market price.
>
> Here is the formula to determine the conversion ratio:

+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
|                            | > Par Value                             |

+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

> Assuming a convertible bond has a conversion price of \$25 per share,

+----------------------------+-------+------------------+-------------+

> In practice, to determine whether or not to hold the bond or convert
> into the underlying stock, conversion parity can be calculated.
> **Conversion parity** is the point at which neither a profit nor loss
> is made at conversion.

######### [Eurodollar Bonds]{.underline} 

> **Eurodollar bonds** are bonds issued outside the United States (e.g.,
> in Argentina), but denominated in US dollars. These are issued and
> trade outside the US and are not registered with the SEC. Issuers use
> Eurodollar bonds to make their securities more marketable, for
> example, if their home currency is unstable.

######### [Secondary Market Trading]{.underline} 

> The **secondary market** for fixed-income securities is the largest
> financial market in the world. Most types of fixed-income securities,
> including corporate bonds, trade **over-the- counter (OTC)**, between
> banks, broker-dealers, and other market participants that buy and sell
> securities by computer or phone. This is distinct from the equity
> markets, whose trading is primarily conducted on exchanges.
>
> One reason for this is that the largest companies can have hundreds of
> outstanding bond issues at the same time. As a result, the average
> bond trades far less frequently than that same issuer's common stock;
> this reason also drives the bid--ask spread wider, to compen- sate
> dealers for the risk they take when holding bonds.
>
> ***Example***
>
> IBM may have dozens or hundreds of outstanding bond issues at any
> time, each with different characteristics and features---including
> time until maturity and interest rate. An investor who wants IBM
> fixed-income instruments could invest in any one of these instru-
> ments, meaning there will be fewer investors interested in any *one*
> bond at a specific time.

###### US Government Securities

> The US government has historically been the largest issuer of debt in
> the world, with over
>
> \$20 trillion in outstanding securities as of 2018. Securities issued
> by the US government are considered the safest that can be purchased.
> Default risk is nearly absent, as these securities are guaranteed by
> the full faith and credit of the US government, which is supported by
> its ability to raise tax revenues and print currency.
>
> *Chapter 3*

######## Types of Bonds {#types-of-bonds-4 .unnumbered}

> US government securities are actively traded on the over-the-counter
> market after their initial sale to large investors through auctions
> conducted by the Treasury. They pay less interest than corporate and
> municipal securities because of their unrivaled degree of safety.
>
> Interest paid on US Treasury securities is taxable at the federal
> level, but is exempt from state and local income tax.

######### [Marketable US Government Securities]{.underline} 

> US Treasury securities are the debt financing instruments of the
> United States federal gov- ernment. The US Treasury Department
> oversees the operations of the US government and issues Treasury
> securities when funds are needed. Five types of marketable **Treasury
> secu- rities** are actively traded on the secondary market and are
> highly liquid:

-   Treasury bills

-   Treasury notes

-   Treasury bonds

-   Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)

-   Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities
    program securities (STRIPS)

    1.  ***Treasury Bills***

> **Treasury bills**, or **T-bills**, mature in one year or less. Like
> zero-coupon bonds, they do not pay interest prior to maturity; instead
> they are sold at a discount and mature at par. Many regard Treasury
> bills as the least risky investment available to US investors.
>
> T-bills are issued in denominations of \$100 to \$5,000,000 with
> maturities of four weeks, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks. Treasury
> bills are sold by the US Treasury through sin- gle-price auctions held
> weekly. Banks and financial institutions, especially **primary
> dealers**, are the largest purchasers of T-bills. Primary dealers
> interact with the Federal Reserve by acting as both buyers and sellers
> of government securities.
>
> Treasury bills are quoted for purchase and sale in the secondary
> market on a discounted yield basis. This will be discussed in more
> detail shortly.

2.  ***Treasury Notes***

> **Treasury notes**, or **T-notes**, pay interest every six months, and
> are issued with maturities of two, three, five, seven, or 10 years, in
> denominations of \$100 to \$5,000,000.
>
> The 10-year Treasury note has become the security most frequently
> quoted when discussing the performance of the US government bond
> market.

3.  ***Treasury Bonds***

> **Treasury bonds**, or **T-bonds**, have the longest maturity of
> government securities. They pay interest every six months, like
> T-notes, and are currently issued with a maturity of 30 years. The
> secondary market for Treasury bonds is highly liquid.
>
> T-notes and T-bonds are quoted on the secondary market as a percentage
> of par in 32nds of a point (1/32). For example, a quote of 95:07 or
> 95--07 on a T-note indicates that it is trading at a discount:
> \$952.19 (or 95 7/32%) for a \$1,000 bond.
>
> *Chapter 3*

######## Types of Bonds {#types-of-bonds-5 .unnumbered}

4.  ***TIPS***

> **Treasury inflation-protected securities**, or **TIPS**, are
> inflation-indexed bonds issued by the US Treasury. The principal is
> adjusted semiannually based on the **Consumer Price Index**. The
> coupon rate is constant, but generates a different amount of interest
> when mul- tiplied by the inflation-adjusted principal, thus protecting
> the holder against inflation.

5.  ***Treasury STRIPS***

> The US Treasury's Separate Trading of Registered Interest and
> Principal Securities program allows investors to purchase the
> individual interest and principal components of certain Treasury notes
> and bonds as separate securities, called **STRIPS**. T-notes, T-bonds,
> and TIPS can be separated, or stripped into individual STRIPS
> investments, and then traded in the secondary market. STRIPS are
> effectively zero-coupon bonds issued by the US government.
>
> For example, a 10-year T-note could be stripped into 21 STRIPS,
> resulting in a new security for each of the 20 interest payments and
> one security for the principal payment at the end of the bond's life.

> ***[3.2.1.6 Treasury Receipts]{.underline}***
>
> **Treasury receipts** are zero-coupon bonds that are structured by
> broker-dealers and backed by cash flows from Treasury securities.
> Essentially, a brokerage firms buys a Treasury (e.g., a 10-year
> T-note) and sells separate receipts against the principal and coupon
> payments. Therefore, these securities are backed by a single cash flow
> from a Treasury security, but they are technically direct obligations
> of broker-dealers, not the federal government. Note that, once the US
> government began to back the issuance of STRIPS, treasury receipts
> became much less popular investments.

######### [Quoting Treasury Bills]{.underline} 

> Treasury bills are quoted differently from notes and bonds, since
> bills do not pay an estab- lished rate of interest. An investor's
> return on a bill is the difference between the purchase and sales
> price or, when held to maturity, the face value paid by the Treasury.
> Bills are quoted at a discount from face value, with the discount
> expressed as an annual rate based on a 360- day year. This is known as
> a **discounted yield basis**. Unlike the quotes on notes and bonds,
> bid quotes on bills are always higher than the asked because the
> quoted amount must be subtracted from the face amount to determine the
> price. Put another way, the buyer wants a bigger discount than the
> seller is willing to offer. Below is an example of the bid--ask quote
> for bills:

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| > BID                            | ASK                               |
+==================================+===================================+
| > 1.60%                          | 1.50%                             |
+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

> ***Example***
>
> T-bills might be bid at 0.52% (i.e., 52 bps). This means that buyers
> are willing to pay a discounted price on T-bills that would equate to
> a 0.52% annual yield. Similarly, a seller offering 0.45% (45 bps) is
> selling at a discounted price that would equate to a 0.45% yield.
> Notice the bid is *higher* than the offer. That is the case because
> the buyer wants a big dis- count off par whereas the seller is willing
> to give a smaller discount off par. Put differently, a higher
> discounted yield equates to a lower price.

> Types of Bonds

######  Federal Agency Issues

> Federal government agencies and various **government sponsored
> enterprises (GSEs)** are authorized to raise money through issuing
> debt securities. The securities of these entities are collectively
> called **agency securities**. Agency securities are not issued by the
> US Treasury and are not fully guaranteed by the US government, with
> the exception of the debt of the Government National Mortgage
> Association, **GNMA (Ginnie Mae)**.
>
> Though they are not fully backed by the US government, agency
> securities are considered safe from default, as the US government is
> likely to use its creditworthiness to guarantee investors' interest
> and principal payments. However, since they generally do not carry
> explicit Treasury backing, agency securities provide yields that are
> higher than those of Treasury securities.

######### [Mortgage-Backed Securities]{.underline} 

> **Ginnie Mae**, **Fannie Mae**, and **Freddie Mac** issue
> **mortgage-backed securities (MBS)**. These securities represent
> investments in pools of mortgages, and are backed by mortgage loans.
> Described differently, MBS are simply loans that are sliced up into
> bond-like pieces (i.e., into bonds with \$1,000 par value) and sold to
> investors. This process of converting the mortgages into bonds is
> referred to as **securitization.**
>
> Sometimes referred to as mortgage **pass-through certificates**,
> mortgage securities are an excellent source of current income.
> Mortgage-backed securities are relatively safe and pay slightly higher
> interest than Treasury issues and many investment-grade corporate
> bonds.
>
> **Homeowner Bank**
>
> **Ginnie Mae Fannie Mae Freddie Mac**

**Investors**

> **Broker-Dealers**
>
> **Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)**
>
> Ginnie Mae is a government agency that has the explicit backing of the
> US government. In contrast, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, formerly
> government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), are now publicly traded
> corporations that carry the implied backing of the government. They
> are not *guaranteed* by the full faith and credit of the US
> government.
>
> Mortgage-backed securities generate interest revenue through pools of
> home loan or com- mercial mortgages. MBS investors own an interest in
> a pool of mortgages that serve as the underlying asset for the MBS.
> When homeowners or commercial property owners make their monthly
> payment of interest and a small share of the principal, that money is
> passed through as income to the MBS investors.

*Chapter 3*

######## Types of Bonds {#types-of-bonds-8 .unnumbered}

> Changing interest rates in the market can have a unique effect on the
> underlying mort- gages and therefore impact the mortgage-backed
> securities that are based on those pools of mortgages.

6.  ***Prepayment Risk***

> If interest rates decrease, homeowners will likely prepay their
> mortgages and refinance at a lower rate---hence the term
> ***prepayment* risk**. As the mortgages are prepaid, they will not
> remain outstanding for as long, and therefore, the mortgage-backed
> securities backed by these mortgages will see their maturity decrease.
> This has a similar effect to a bond being called, which results in:

1.  Reinvestment rate risk---investors receive their money back early
    and are forced to reinvest at a lower rate

2.  The bond sees no increase in market value, despite the decline in
    rates, since the bond is acting as a short-term security, which is
    less impacted by changing interest rates.

    1.  ***Extension Risk***

> Alternatively, if interest rates increase, homeowners with a mortgage
> will have no reason to refinance or prepay their mortgages. Therefore,
> the time it takes to repay their mortgages will increase.
>
> As the speed of prepayments declines, the mortgages will remain
> outstanding for longer than initially anticipated. Therefore, the
> mortgage-backed security will see its maturity extended---hence
> ***extension* risk**.
>
> Again, there will be two consequences for investors:

1.  As interest rates increase, bond prices decrease. Because this is a
    long-term bond, which is extremely sensitive to changing rates, its
    price will decrease significantly.

2.  Because the underlying mortgages will remain outstanding for longer
    than initially anticipated, the investor will be stuck in this
    investment for longer.

######### [Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)]{.underline} 

> **Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)** are mortgage-backed
> securities that have been structured by broker-dealers and divided
> into distinct pieces called **tranches**. Each tranche has unique
> characteristics as they relate to credit quality, expected maturity,
> and exposure to prepayments. Each **CMO** is a set of two or more
> tranches, with maturity and cash-flow classes that are designed to
> meet specific investment objectives. The purpose of

######## Types of Bonds {#types-of-bonds-9 .unnumbered}

> these various tranches is to help protect investors against the unique
> risks associated with MBS that were discussed above.
>
> Just like other types of bonds, CMOs pay both interest and principal
> to investors. Additionally, their price is impacted by the credit
> quality of the underlying mortgages.

######### [Asset-Backed Securities]{.underline} 

> An **asset-backed security (ABS)** works similarly to a
> mortgage-backed security. It is based on a pool of underlying
> financial assets that are aggregated into financial instruments and
> sold to investors. However, rather than being backed by mortgages, the
> financial assets back- ing these securities range from credit card
> debt and auto loans to more complex cash-flow arrangements such as
> aircraft leases, royalty payments, and movie revenues. Most types of
> financial assets can be structured into an ABS.
>
> Asset-backed securities are attractive to investors because of the
> variety of maturities, risks, and coupons available. They are secured
> by the underlying pooled assets, so their credit quality is directly
> related to the quality of the underlying loans and borrowers.

#### Progress Check---Solutions {#progress-checksolutions-2 .unnumbered}

1.  (**D**) The trust indenture, a written agreement between the bond
    issuer and a trustee, includes various covenants. Each covenant is a
    promise that protects the interests of bondholders. For example, a
    covenant can prevent issuers from selling key assets.

2.  (**A**) Secured bonds have the highest liquidation priority,
    followed, in order, by unsecured bondholders and general creditors,
    and then subordinated debt and convertible bonds. All bondholders
    rank ahead of equity holders (preferred and common) in liquidation
    priority.

3.  (**C**) The convertible bond investor has an option to convert the
    bonds into common stock of the issuer. If the underlying common
    stock performs well, convertibles can have significant price upside.
    However, they generally carry a lower coupon than nonconvertibles of
    the same issuer.

4.  (**B**) Treasury notes (T-notes) have maturities ranging from two to
    10 years. Similar to Treasury bonds, they pay a fixed semiannual
    interest.

5.  (**A**) STRIPS are very high-quality, long-term, zero-coupon bonds
    backed by the US Treasury.

6.  (**A**) Treasury bills (T-bills) are effectively zero-coupon
    securities. Interest earned by the investor is the difference
    between the discounted purchase price and the value received at
    maturity.

7.  (**B**) Most mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are not backed by the
    full faith and credit of the US government. They are backed by pools
    of mortgage loans. Ginnie Maes (GNMAs)

> are the exception; they are backed by the government's full faith and
> credit, while Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs carry the government's
> *implicit backing*.

8.  (**B**) Most mortgages can be refinanced, and homeowners are most
    likely to refinance when mortgage rates are falling---i.e.,
    lower-rate alternatives are available. This increases the prepayment
    risk in mortgage pools, the collateral backing MBS. It means MBS
    investors must reinvest more returned principal in a lower-rate
    environment.

###### Municipal Securities

> **Municipal securities** finance many projects for the public good.
> Also called **munis**, they support the day-to-day obligations of
> states, counties, cities, and their agencies. Nearly every state,
> county, city, political subdivision, and US territory relies on
> raising funds through the municipal securities market. Issuers of
> municipal bonds include:

-   States

-   Cities

-   Counties

-   Towns

-   Villages

-   Interstate authorities (e.g., Port Authority of New York and New
    Jersey)

-   Intrastate authorities (e.g., Long Island Power Authority), and

-   US territories, possessions, and commonwealths, including Guam,
    Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands

> These issuers often rely on a **municipal advisor**, which is a person
> or firm that provides advice to the municipal entity with respect to
> the issuance process, helping the municipality to determine what type
> of municipal securities to issue along with the structure and terms of
> the deal.
>
> Once issued, these securities are backed by taxes or revenues received
> by the issuer, subject to applicable provisions of state or local law.
>
> Unlike the market for Treasury securities, the secondary market for
> municipal bonds is highly illiquid because each issuance is unique,
> with its own credit structure, terms, and conditions. As a result, the
> chances of a specific bond being available in the market at any given
> time are relatively small. Additionally, many municipal bonds are
> purchased by buy- and-hold investors who want to benefit from the
> potential tax benefits of these securities (which will be discussed
> later).

######### [General Obligation Bonds]{.underline} 

> **General obligation bonds**, or **GO bonds**, are municipal bonds
> that are backed by the "full faith and credit" of the issuer. The
> principal and interest on these bonds is guaranteed by revenues raised
> by the issuer, primarily from its taxing authority. They are not
> backed by specific assets. The legislative authority of the issuing
> municipality can also be called upon. For example, an act of a state
> legislature may make funds available to pay bondholders.
>
> *Chapter 3*

######## Types of Bonds {#types-of-bonds-10 .unnumbered}

> GO bonds give municipalities a tool to raise funds for
> non-revenue-producing, long-term capital projects. GO bonds are
> typically used to fund projects and infrastructure improve- ments that
> will serve the entire community, including roads, parks, government
> buildings, and school buildings.
>
> *Chapter 3*

######## Types of Bonds {#types-of-bonds-11 .unnumbered}

> Aside from levying income taxes or sales taxes to pay principal and
> interest, states and local municipalities can use various types of
> fees, such as license fees, to provide backing for GOs.
>
> Most counties, cities, towns, and villages also rely on various kinds
> of **ad valorem** taxes for backing GO bond issues. Ad valorem taxes
> are based on the value of a transaction---exam- ples include sales tax
> and property tax. Ad valorem taxes can be assessed when property is
> purchased. They may also be levied on an ongoing basis.
>
> Property and real-estate taxes are the most common types of ad valorem
> taxes used to redeem GO bond issues. For example, if a school district
> creates a bond issue to fund a new school building, it might increase
> the property tax rate in the district to ensure that it will have
> sufficient income to meet its principal and interest obligations.
>
> Property taxes are computed on the assessed value of a property, not
> the market value. Additionally, property taxes are only levied at the
> local level, not the state level.
>
> The precise source and priority of payment for general obligation
> bonds may vary consider- ably from issuer to issuer depending on
> applicable state or local law.

> ***[3.4.1.1 Debt Limits]{.underline}***
>
> The issuer's taxing authority may be subject to certain **debt
> limits**. A debt limit establishes the total amount of GO principal
> that can be outstanding at any time. Issuers who have out- standing
> debt that falls substantially below their debt limits are generally
> viewed as offering greater safety to investors.
>
> Further contributing to the safety of GO bonds is that many proposed
> new issues are subject to voter approval as imposed by a state's
> constitution or statutes or by local ordinance. This is often called a
> bond referendum. For example, a school district may require that a
> **bond referendum** pass with a two-thirds majority before the school
> district can proceed with building a new gymnasium.
>
> Although state or local laws greatly impact the source and priority of
> payments to bond- holders, GO bonds are valued for their relative
> safety. They may be rated similarly to US
>
> Treasury securities and high-grade corporate bonds. This high credit
> rating exists because municipalities generally have the option of
> raising taxes or levying new taxes to meet their obligation to
> bondholders.

######### [Revenue Bonds]{.underline} 

> As the name suggests, **revenue bonds** are backed by a specific
> source of revenue associated with the project for which financing has
> been secured. For example, if revenue bonds are issued to build a
> convention center, the fees collected from persons who use the
> facility and attend concerts, meetings, or sporting events will pay
> the expenses of building and mainte- nance along with the ongoing
> principal and interest owed to bondholders.
>
> Typical issuers of revenue bonds include:

-   Entities that provide an essential public service---most commonly:

    -   Transportation systems

    -   Power systems

    -   Sewer systems

-   Water systems

-   Nonprofit organizations, also known as 501(c) organizations, and

-   Private-sector corporations, such as hospitals

> Unlike GO bonds, revenue bonds do not rely on the general funds of an
> issuing authority or depend on raising additional taxes. Instead, the
> principal and interest payments to revenue bondholders are made by the
> stream of income that is generated by the project. The issuer of a
> revenue bond is not obligated to pay principal and interest on the
> bonds it issues from any source other than those revenues specifically
> pledged to debt service.
>
> Generally, any political entity or government agency that generates
> operating expenses or revenues can issue revenue bonds. However, an
> agency that provides a free service, such as a public school, cannot
> issue revenue bonds because its revenue source is limited to tax
> dollars or government funding.
>
> Revenue bonds offer municipalities financing flexibility. Because
> these bonds are not backed by tax revenue, they can be issued outside
> of the issuer's legislative debt limits. They help ensure that
> improvements can move forward without burdening the municipality and
> its constituents with additional direct debt obligations.
>
> ***[3.4.2.1 The Bond Indenture and Covenants]{.underline}***
>
> Because they are backed by user charges, rather than the taxing power
> of the municipality, revenue bonds are generally issued with a **bond
> indenture** (i.e., **trust indenture**).
>
> As with corporate bond issues, the trust indenture for revenue bonds
> is a series of prom- ises between the issuer and a trustee. The bond
> indenture includes a number of protective **covenants**, or promises,
> that cover details of the issue as well as day-to-day management
> matters. The purpose of the document is to protect and reassure
> bondholders.
>
> Although munis are not subject to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
> which applies to corporate

######### [Short-Term Municipal Obligations]{.underline} 

> Municipalities can also issue short-term obligations, which typically
> mature in one year or less but otherwise share many features with the
> municipal bonds already discussed.
>
> ***[3.4.4.1 Municipal Notes]{.underline}***
>
> A **municipal note** is a short-term, high-quality municipal issue
> that is sold by a municipality to help manage its cash flow. Notes are
> usually issued in anticipation of funds from another source or
> longer-term financing. A number of different types of municipal notes
> exist, but the most popular ones are mentioned below.

######### Tax Anticipation Notes (TANs) {#tax-anticipation-notes-tans .unnumbered}

> As the name implies, these notes are issued in anticipation of future
> tax receipts. For exam- ple, a municipality may issue a **tax
> anticipation note (TAN)** that will be repaid by receipts from ad
> valorem taxes that are due at a future date.

######### Revenue Anticipation Notes (RANs) {#revenue-anticipation-notes-rans .unnumbered}

> These municipal notes are issued in anticipation of receiving non-tax
> revenues in the future. Sales taxes are a typical backing for
> **revenue anticipation notes (RANs)**.

######### Bond Anticipation Notes (BANs) {#bond-anticipation-notes-bans .unnumbered}

> **Bond anticipation notes (BANs)** are typically issued to support
> capital projects, and are repaid by proceeds from the issuance of
> long-term bonds. They provide interim financing until the bond issue
> can be prepared and sold.

######### [Taxation of Municipal Securities Interest]{.underline} 

> One of the primary benefits of investing in municipal bonds is that
> interest paid on these bonds is generally exempt from federal income
> tax, and it may also be exempt from state and local taxes. Because of
> this advantage, investors are willing to accept lower interest
> payments than on other types of debt securities, assuming comparable
> risk.
>
> The tax exemption of interest is also beneficial to municipal issuers,
> as it allows them to borrow money at a lower cost by issuing bonds
> with lower coupon rates.
>
> Purchasers of municipal bonds should be aware that not all municipal
> bonds are tax-ex- empt, and not all tax-exempt bonds are free from all
> federal and state taxes. The laws gov- erning the taxability of
> municipal bond income are complex. At the federal level, these laws
> are contained in the Internal Revenue Code, while each state has its
> own laws that identify which bonds, if any, are exempt from state
> taxes.
>
> *Chapter 3*

######## Types of Bonds {#types-of-bonds-14 .unnumbered}

> ***[3.4.5.1 Federal Tax Exemption]{.underline}***
>
> A federal income tax exemption applies to the interest paid on
> **public purpose municipal bonds**, which are those that benefit the
> municipality at large. This means that the interest received from
> **public purpose bonds** is free from federal income tax. Capital
> gains, however, are taxable.
>
> The federal tax exemption for interest income sets municipal bonds
> apart from the bonds of other issuers. Because of this unique tax
> feature, the term "**tax-free investment**" is often used
> interchangeably with "municipal bond investment."
>
> For example, assume an investor purchases \$1,000's worth of NY state
> municipal bonds with a 4% coupon. Each year the investor receives \$40
> of tax-free income. Meanwhile, an investor who owns a 4% corporate
> bond would be required to pay taxes on the \$40 of annual interest
> income.
>
> Due to this tax advantage, the investor will accept a lower yield from
> a municipal security than from similar taxable securities. Because of
> this yield differential, the investor's tax status plays a major
> factor in the attractiveness of municipal investments. While municipal
> securities could benefit investors in any tax bracket, they tend to
> appeal the most to those in the highest tax brackets.
>
> *Chapter 3*

######## Types of Bonds {#types-of-bonds-15 .unnumbered}

> ***3.4.5.2 State Taxation of Interest***
>
> In most states, the interest income from municipal bonds issued by the
> state, its agencies, or its political subdivisions is free from state
> income taxes in that state.
>
> For instance, a resident of New York who buys any public purpose bond
> issued by a munici- pality in New York will not have to pay New York
> state income taxes on the interest income. However, if the same New
> York resident purchases a California public purpose bond, the investor
> will owe New York state income taxes on the interest.
>
> Locales with city taxes, such as New York City, may also have a tax
> exemption for inter- est from qualifying bonds at the city tax level.
> A qualified New York City municipal bond, for example, would be
> **triple-tax-free**---exempt from federal, state, and local
> taxes---for an investor living in New York City.
>
> The benefit of not paying state and possibly local income taxes, in
> addition to not paying federal income taxes, increases the value of
> the tax exemption even more. When it comes to the state exemption, the
> higher a state's income tax, the greater the incentive for state
> residents to purchase their state's bonds. Conversely, states without
> an income tax must offer slightly higher yields to attract both
> in-state and out-of-state buyers.
>
> Interest from **territory bonds** is generally exempt from taxation by
> federal, state, and local authorities anywhere in the US. Therefore,
> US-territory bonds are also considered triple-tax- free. US
> territories include Guam, Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin
> Islands.
>
> ***3.4.5.3 Taxable Municipal Securities Interest***
>
> The interest on some municipal securities is taxable by the federal
> government. The primary driver behind this tax treatment is that the
> financed activities are not providing significant benefit to the
> public. For example, bonds that are issued to finance stadiums or
> build exec- utive private jet airports are **private-purpose** or
> **private activity** municipal issues that may not qualify for a
> federal or state tax exemption.
>
> **Industrial development revenue (IDR) bonds**, which are bonds issued
> for the benefit of a private corporation, are also considered private
> activity bonds. For example, a municipal- ity might issue an IDR to
> build a commercial office building and then lease the facility to a
> company. The bonds encourage economic development and job creation,
> but because the immediate benefit belongs to the private company, they
> are taxable.

######### Alternative Minimum Tax and Private Activity Bonds {#alternative-minimum-tax-and-private-activity-bonds .unnumbered}

> Investors who own certain types of private activity bonds may be
> subject to the **alternative minimum tax (AMT)**. The **AMT** is a
> separate tax computation under the Internal Revenue Code that, in
> effect, counteracts many other tax deductions or credits. It was
> designed to ensure that high-income persons with numerous tax
> deductions and credits pay their fair share of income tax. The AMT
> requirement can create a tax liability for an individual who would
> otherwise pay little or no tax.
>
> The AMT must be calculated separately from the normal tax calculation,
> and then com- pared. Whichever calculation results in the higher tax
> is the one that must be paid. The AMT calculation begins with the
> regular income amount and then makes certain adjustments to that
> income. Included in the AMT calculation is interest on private
> activity bonds.
>
> The customer's trade confirmation includes whether the income is
> subject to the AMT, and if the bond was purchased in the primary
> market. The front cover of the **official statement**, which is a
> municipal bond's primary disclosure document, will indicate whether
> the bond is subject to the AMT. For context, a picture of an official
> statement appears below.

###### Money Market Instruments

> The **money market** is the part of the global fixed-income market
> that issues and trades debt instruments with the shortest
> maturities---typically less than one year. Money market instruments
> are considered near-cash assets. They are issued by government
> entities, finan- cial institutions, and corporations, and their
> quality can vary widely, based on the issuer's credit rating. However,
> most money market instruments are relatively liquid and low in risk
> compared to longer-term bonds. Investors are never far away from
> receiving a promised return of principal, which can be reinvested in
> other opportunities.
>
> Although individual investors participate in the money market, it is
> primarily an institu- tional market, in which large-denomination
> trades are the norm. Individual investors who enter this market often
> do so through pooled funds, such as money market mutual funds, to take
> advantage of economies of scale. The most important types of money
> market instru- ments are described below.

> Money market funds are generally considered the safest possible

######## Types of Bonds {#types-of-bonds-17 .unnumbered}

######### Commercial Paper (CP)

> **Commercial paper (CP)** is a negotiable, unsecured debt instrument
> issued by a corpora- tion to finance short-term operating expenses and
> working capital needs. Most commercial paper is issued in the form of
> **promissory notes**. They are typically issued at a discount to their
> maturity value, with the discount representing interest that will be
> paid at maturity. In order for commercial paper to be exempt from SEC
> registration under the '33 Act, maturities may not exceed 270 days.

######### Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

> **Certificates of deposit (CDs)** are deposit accounts or promissory
> notes issued by banks with fixed maturities. They pay interest through
> maturity and may have limited liquidity or withdrawal penalties if
> redeemed prior to maturity. Individuals are attracted to CDs largely
> because principal and interest is insured up to a limit (currently
> \$250,000 per depositor) by the **Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
> (FDIC)**.

1.  ***Non-Negotiable CDs***

> Most CDs offered to individuals are **non-negotiable CDs**, which
> means they cannot be resold, and can only be redeemed by the issuing
> bank. Because they cannot be traded, non-negotiable CDs are not
> considered securities and do not trade in the money market.

2.  ***Negotiable CDs***

> **Negotiable CDs** are transferable to other investors; therefore,
> they are considered securities and can be traded in the secondary
> market. However, for many negotiable CDs, the sec- ondary markets tend
> to be quite limited. Some CDs can be redeemed with the issuing bank
> prior to maturity (though generally an early redemption fee applies)
> if an investor cannot liquidate a negotiable CD in the market. Many
> negotiable CDs have maturities of one year or less though they can
> also be issued with multi-year maturities. The minimum face value of
> negotiable CDs is \$100,000.

######### Banker's Acceptances (BAs)

> A **banker's acceptance (BA)** is a short-term negotiable debt
> instrument issued by a bor- rower and guaranteed by a commercial bank.
> Technically, it is a time draft drawn on a deposit at a bank. This
> means it is like a corporate check, without a checking account, which

> Traditionally, BAs were used to finance international trade. Importers
> would ask their banks to issue BAs maturing on the date their payments
> were due, with the maturity value drawn against their deposit accounts
> at the bank. Exporters could then receive BAs, secure in the knowledge
> that a bank stood behind payment. If exporters needed immediate cash,
> they could sell BAs on the secondary market prior to maturity.

######### [Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements]{.underline} 

> A **repurchase agreement**, or a **repo**, is a contractual
> arrangement between two parties, in which one party agrees to sell
> securities to another party at a specified price with a commit- ment
> to buy the securities back at a later date for another specified
> price. The higher repur- chase price includes interest to the lender.
> Repos are similar to short-term interest-bearing loans against
> collateral.
>
> Whether the transaction is a repo or a **reverse repo** depends on the
> party to the contract. If the party is lending the securities to later
> buy them back, it is a repo. The buyer in the same transaction is
> engaging in a reverse repo.
>
> The Federal Reserve System uses repurchase and reverse repurchase
> agreements with mem- ber banks to impact monetary policy. Repos
> temporarily add reserve balances to the bank- ing system, while
> reverse repos temporarily drain balances from the system. This
> activity affects money supply and interest rates.

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-2 .unnumbered}

1.  (**B**) To calculate the conversion ratio, divide par value by the
    conversion price.

> \$1,000/\$20 = 50.

2.  (**D**) Long-term, zero-coupon bonds (such as STRIPS) are the most
    volatile in the face of changing interest rates.

3.  (**A**) US Treasuries are *by far* the most liquid debt issues in
    the secondary market, with very narrow bid--ask spreads.

4.  (**D**) The maximum maturity of a Treasury bill (T-bill) is 52
    weeks. Treasuries with longer maturities are Treasury notes
    (T-notes) and Treasury bonds (T-bonds).

5.  (**D**) T-notes and T-bonds are quoted as a percentage of par in
    32nds of a point. 1 point equals \$10, and each 32nd equals 0.3125.
    You could reason that 24/32nds is three- fourths of a point equals
    \$7.50, so \$970 + \$7.50 = \$977.50.

6.  (**B**) TIPS are Treasury inflation-protected securities. They are
    issued by the Treasury and carry the US government's full faith and
    credit. Principal is adjusted semiannually based on the Consumer
    Price Index to protect investors against inflation.

7.  (**A**) Although T-bonds are of very high quality, they do have
    reinvestment rate risk, which is the risk that the semiannual coupon
    payments that the investor receives will be reinvested back into the
    market at a lower rate. Because STRIPS do not have coupons, they
    have no reinvestment rate risk.

8.  (**D**) The spread, or the gap between the bid and ask prices, is a
    direct indicator of trading liquidity---the ability to buy or sell
    quickly and at an advantageous price. The lower the spread, the
    greater the liquidity. The spread is an indirect indicator of
    trading volume. Lower spreads usually (but not always) indicate
    higher trading volume.

9.  (**C**) Mortgage pass-through securities hold pools of
    mortgages---residential or commercial. As mortgage payments are
    made, the pools pass through to the securities holders and both
    principal and interest are paid. The mortgages held by the pools are
    the main collateral backing the securities.

10. (**C**) GO bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the
    issuer, a county in this case. This means the full taxing power of
    the county. The largest source of tax revenue for most counties is
    ad valorem (property) taxes. The county can increase these taxes, if
    necessary, to fulfill its obligations to bondholders.

11. (**B**) Federal tax exemption applies to the interest paid on public
    purpose municipal bonds. This makes these bonds attractive, relative
    to taxable bonds, for investors in high tax brackets. However, these
    bonds are generally not suitable for retirement accounts that
    already benefit from tax sheltering.

12. (**C**) Municipal bond interest is tax-free at the federal level. If
    the investor is a resident of the state of issuance, it is also
    tax-free at the state and local levels. Otherwise, state and local
    taxes apply.

13. (**A**) Most types of fixed-income securities (except municipal
    bonds) pay interest that

> is taxable by both the federal and state/local governments. However,
> interest paid on US Treasuries is exempt from state and local income
> taxes. (It is subject to federal income taxes.)

14. (**B**) A money market mutual fund is an investment company that
    pools investors' capital

> in *short-term* instruments such as Treasury bills, certificates of
> deposit, and highly rated commercial paper. Long-term municipal bonds
> are not eligible securities for money market funds.

15. (**C**) Commercial paper is a negotiable, unsecured debt instrument
    issued by corporations to finance short-term needs. Most commercial
    paper is issued in promissory note form.

16. (**D**) Negotiable CDs have many of the same characteristics as
    regular CDs. They are issued by banks and carry FDIC insurance
    coverage, currently up to \$250,000 per depositor. Also, they pay
    interest that is taxable. Key differences are 1) a larger minimum
    face value (at least \$100,000) and 2) ability to be transferred to
    other investors through secondary- market sales.

### Investment Company Securities

> **Investment company** securities are collections of diverse pools of
> securities that are selected and managed by professionals. They
> combine multiple assets into a single invest- ment opportunity that
> can be purchased by retail investors, giving them the chance for
> significant diversification with a smaller investment. The
> professional management of these investments is appealing to
> individuals who lack either the aptitude or desire to select and
> actively manage a portfolio of securities. By owning more than one
> security, investors assume less risk than by owning individual
> securities within the pool.
>
> Investment companies are like corporations in that they raise capital
> through selling shares to the public. In this process, their shares
> are subject to the same registration and disclosure requirements
> imposed by the Securities Act of 1933 as other corporate securities.
>
> According to the **Investment Company Act of 1940**, or **1940 Act**,
> which regulates these entities, three broad categories of investment
> companies exist:

1.  Face-amount certificate companies

2.  Unit investment trusts (UITs), and

3.  Management companies (which include both closed-end funds and
    open-end funds)

> **Face-amount certificates** are a type of investment company that
> issues debt securities, backed by interest on real property and
> securities. Because very few still exist today, they are not important
> for the exam. Instead, this chapter will focus on the other types of
> investment companies and their shares. For context, the table below
> details the investment companies that will be discussed:

    based on their investment objectives as well as the associated
    risks.

####### Key Terms {#key-terms-3 .unnumbered}

-   **Management investment company**---An investment company, such as a
    mutual fund or closed-end fund, that hires an investment adviser to
    actively select and manage a securities portfolio to achieve a
    stated investment goal

-   **Mutual fund**---A type of management investment company that makes
    a continuous offering of brand new, redeemable shares to investors,
    also referred to as an **open-end fund**

-   **Redeemable**---A type of investment company security, such as a
    mutual fund and a unit investment trust, for which there is no
    secondary market or investor-to- investor trading; instead the
    security is directly bought from and sold back to the issuer.

-   **Net asset value (NAV)**---The value of a mutual fund and the basis
    of what investors pay, calculated as the total assets of the fund
    minus its total liabilities

-   **Forward pricing**---The method by which mutual funds calculate the
    purchase and redemption prices, which are based on the next NAV
    calculation after the order is received

-   **Breakpoints**---Offer mutual fund investors discounts off the
    sales charge based on the dollar amount invested

-   **Closed-end fund**---A type of investment company that issues
    exchange-traded shares that reflect actively managed portfolios

-   **Unit investment trust (UIT)**---A type of investment company that
    issues redeemable securities representing an undivided interest in a
    fixed trust, in which there is no active management of the portfolio

-   **Exchange-traded fund (ETF)**---An exchange-traded investment
    company that is designed to closely track the performance of a
    specific benchmark, sector, or index

###### Management Investment Companies

> **Management investment companies** are the most common type of
> investment company. Management companies actively manage a portfolio
> of securities to achieve a stated invest- ment objective. The
> management company will hire a professional manager, such as an
> **investment adviser**, whose role is to select the securities and
> manage the portfolio. These individuals and firms are regulated under
> the **Investment Advisers Act of 1940** and gener- ally must be
> registered with and regulated by the SEC.
>
> There are two types of management companies, closed-end funds and
> open-end funds.

###### Mutual Funds

> **Open-end investment company securities**, which are also known as
> **mutual funds**, are the most popular type of investment company
> security.
>
> Each fund must have a clearly defined investment objective. This
> investment objective can only be changed by a majority vote of the
> fund's outstanding shares.
>
> Mutual funds are a popular choice among investors because of the
> features they offer. Major selling points include:

-   **Professional management**---Fund managers do the research, select
    the securities, and monitor the performance.

-   **Diversification**---Because they invest in a range of companies
    and industries, mutual funds keep investors from putting all of
    their eggs in one basket. This helps spread risk and protect the
    shareholders from the failure of a single company.

-   **Affordability**---Most mutual funds can be purchased for a
    relatively low dollar amount for both initial investment and
    subsequent purchases.

-   **Liquidity**---Mutual fund shares can be easily redeemed at any
    time for the current net asset value (NAV) plus any redemption fees.
    Shareholders will receive the price that is next calculated when
    they make a redemption request.

######### [Information Provided to Mutual Fund Investors]{.underline} 

> Aside from being subject to the 1940 Act, broker-dealers and their
> representatives who sell mutual fund shares are also subject to the
> rules of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
>
> The SEC establishes mutual fund financial disclosure requirements and
> sets limits on the fees that funds are allowed to charge. It does not,
> however, directly supervise the investment decisions or activities of
> these companies or judge the merits of their investments.
>
> All investors that purchase mutual fund shares must receive a
> **prospectus** that contains certain disclosures. The SEC allows an
> investment company to deliver a **summary prospec- tus** to customers,
> which is a condensed version of the longer, more detailed prospectus.
> The summary prospectus reviews critical information in plain English
> to help make it easy for investors to compare funds. Included are
> seven key items:

-   The fund's investment objectives

-   A fee table

-   Principal investment strategies, risk, and performance history

> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

######## Securities {#securities .unnumbered}

> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

######## Securities {#securities-1 .unnumbered}

-   The names of the fund's advisers and portfolio managers

-   Information about purchasing and selling fund shares

-   Tax information, and

-   Compensation paid to financial intermediaries for selling the fund
    to investors

> For comparison, a complete prospectus could be about 50 pages whereas
> a summary pro- spectus is usually 10--12 pages.
>
> If a summary prospectus is delivered, the investment company must also
> make a full pro- spectus and any supplemental fund information
> available upon request in either written or electronic form.
> Prospectuses must be kept current and updated annually.
>
> In addition to a prospectus and summary prospectus, mutual funds must
> provide share- holders with semiannual financial reports. These
> reports must include a balance sheet, an income statement, and a
> snapshot of the mutual fund's portfolio.

######### [Structure of a Mutual Fund]{.underline} 

> Unlike normal corporations, mutual funds have no employees. They rely
> on third parties or service providers that are either affiliate
> organizations or independent contractors to invest the fund's assets
> and carry out the necessary business activities.

1.  ***Board of Directors***

> All mutual funds are required by law to have a board of directors. The
> board oversees the management and operations of the fund on behalf of
> the fund's shareholders, but it is not involved in day-to-day
> management activities.
>
> The 1940 Act generally requires that the board be elected by the
> fund's shareholders. It also requires that at least 40% of the
> directors be independent, meaning they do not have a sig- nificant
> business relationship with the fund's adviser, principal underwriter
> (distributor), or affiliates. The independent directors serve as
> "independent watchdogs" over the manage- ment of the fund, providing
> objective guidance.

2.  ***Investment Adviser***

> The board of directors hires an **investment adviser** to take
> responsibility for the following:

-   Invest the cash and securities held in the fund's portfolio

-   Implement the objectives outlined by the board, and

-   Manage day-to-day trading of the portfolio

> The investment adviser earns an annual **management fee**. This fee is
> typically a percentage of the fund's net asset value. The investment
> adviser's contract is approved annually by the board of directors.

1.  ***Custodian***

> The **custodian** is an institution that acts as the caretaker of the
> fund's securities. It holds in safekeeping all of the securities
> purchased by the investment company for its portfolio.

2.  ***Transfer Agent***

> Mutual funds contract a **transfer agent** to handle transactions with
> customers. The transfer agent's responsibilities include the
> following:

-   Issuing, redeeming, and cancelling fund shares

-   Handling the distribution of dividend and capital gains to
    shareholders, and

-   Sending out trade confirmations when shares are purchased or sold

> The custodian and transfer agent are often the same entity. The mutual
> fund compensates both the custodian and transfer agent with a fee for
> services rendered.
>
> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

######## Securities {#securities-2 .unnumbered}

> ***[4.2.2.5 Sponsor]{.underline}***
>
> The fund contracts a **sponsor**, also called a **distributor** or an
> **underwriter**, to sell its shares. The sponsor has an annually
> renewable written contract with the mutual fund company that permits
> it to buy shares from the fund at **net asset value**. Net asset value
> is the value of the fund's assets, minus all of the fund's
> liabilities, divided by the number of shares. In practice, investors
> do not make much of a distinction between the mutual fund itself and
> its sponsors. For example, Fidelity Investments is the sponsor of
> hundreds of mutual funds.
>
> The sponsor then resells the fund shares to the public at the net
> asset value plus a **sales charge**. This total is called the **public
> offering price (POP)**. The sale to the public either takes place
> directly through the sponsor's sales force, or via outside
> broker-dealers. If the sponsor distributes shares through dealers, the
> dealers purchase shares from the sponsor at a discount to the public
> offering price and fill their customers' orders at the public offer-
> ing price. Broker-dealers that distribute a mutual fund's shares must
> have a written selling agreement with the sponsor. This agreement
> gives them the contractual right to purchase shares at a price below
> the public offering price for resale.

######### [Trading Restrictions on Mutual Funds]{.underline} 

> The SEC restricts certain fund investment and sales activities for
> mutual funds. Mutual funds are generally prohibited from engaging in
> the following activities:

-   Selling securities short

-   Buying securities on margin (meaning with borrowed funds), and

-   Participating in joint investment or trading accounts

> Note that mutual funds are limited to the issuance of a single type of
> equity shares. They can issue common shares only, not senior
> securities like preferred stock or bonds.

######### [Types of Mutual Funds by Investment Objective]{.underline} 

> The fund manager selects securities for the fund's portfolio and
> conducts trading practices to meet the fund's stated investment
> objective. The investment objective helps an investor determine
> whether a fund is a good fit for the investor's overall portfolio.
>
> In general, mutual funds offer three ways for investors to earn money:

-   **Dividend payments**---A mutual fund may earn income from dividends
    > on the stock or interest on the bonds that it holds in its
    > portfolio. The fund distributes this income less fund expenses to
    > shareholders.

-   **Capital gains distributions**---The value of the securities in a
    > fund may rise over time. When a fund sells a security that
    > appreciated, the fund has a capital gain. At the end of the year,
    > the fund distributes these capital gains, minus any capital
    > losses, to investors.

-   **Net asset value (NAV) increases**---When the market value of a
    > fund's portfolio increases above the fund's expenses, the value of
    > the fund and each share of the

> fund increases. The higher NAV reflects growth in the value of an
> investor's shares. Investors who then choose to liquidate their shares
> will do so at a profit.

> ***[4.2.4.1 Mutual Fund Categories]{.underline}***
>
> Mutual funds are organized into categories by asset class (stocks,
> bonds, and cash) and fur- ther categorized by style, objective, or
> strategy. For example, there are money market mutual funds, stock
> mutual funds, and bond mutual funds. Stock and bond funds, as primary
> fund types, have numerous sub-categories that further describe the
> investment style of the fund. Knowledge of these fund categories helps
> mutual fund investors choose the best funds for their particular goals
> and needs.
>
> There are two main types of mutual funds: **actively managed funds**
> and **index funds**. In an actively managed fund, a fund seeks to
> exceed the average returns of the market through security selection
> and trading activity. Index mutual funds are passively managed and
> oper- ate with limited trading activity. These will be discussed later
> in this section.
>
> Most actively managed mutual funds fall into one of four main
> categories:

-   Money market funds

-   Stock funds

-   Bond funds, and

-   Asset allocation funds

> ***[4.2.4.2 Money Market Funds]{.underline}***
>
> **Money market funds** are considered the safest and most stable of
> all the mutual fund types because the 1940 Act restricts their
> investment choices to high-quality, highly liquid, short- term debt
> investments. These include debt instruments with remaining maturities
> of not more than 13 months, such as Treasury bills, commercial paper,
> and negotiable CDs. Because of their liquidity, they are considered
> **cash equivalent funds**.
>
> Money market funds aspire to keep their net asset value (NAV), or the
> value of each share, at a constant \$1 per share. However, this stable
> value is not guaranteed: In unusual circum- stances, the NAV may fall
> below \$1 if the fund's investments perform poorly, which is referred
> to as **breaking the buck**. Investors use these funds as a place to
> "park" short-term dollars, with the expectation that they will receive
> their principal back plus some earnings when they liquidate their
> investments.
>
> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

######## Securities {#securities-5 .unnumbered}

> Money market funds are typically **no-load**, meaning the investor
> does not pay a sales charge to purchase or redeem the shares.
>
> Money market funds are suitable for investors that require safety,
> stability, and a high degree of liquidity. They may not be appropriate
> for investors that need to keep pace with inflation, as the returns of
> money market funds are relatively low. They are frequently used as a
> vehicle for keeping funds highly liquid so they can be accessed as
> needed for another investment opportunity or an immediate cash need,
> for example, the purchase of a home.
>
> ***[4.2.4.3 Stock Funds]{.underline}***
>
> A **stock fund** (i.e., **equity fund)** is a mutual fund that invests
> in stocks of companies that align with its investment objective. The
> goal of most equity funds is long-term growth through capital gains,
> although income from dividends is also available through stock fund
> investments.

######### Categorization by Capitalization {#categorization-by-capitalization .unnumbered}

> One way of categorizing stock funds is by the size or market
> capitalization of the companies they invest in.

-   **Large-cap stock funds** invest in stocks of the largest
    corporations with market capitalizations often exceeding \$10
    billion, such as Wal-Mart, GE, Pfizer, Apple, and Microsoft.
    Typically, large-cap stocks are considered relatively stable and
    secure; they are often referred to as **blue chip stocks**.

-   **Small-cap stock funds** invest in stocks of smaller corporations
    (generally between

> \$750 million and \$2 billion). Small-cap stocks present the
> possibility of greater capital appreciation but with greater risk.

######### Categorization by Investment Strategy {#categorization-by-investment-strategy .unnumbered}

> Stock funds are also categorized by the types of stocks in which they
> invest. Common cat- egorizations include:

-   **Growth stock funds** invest in stocks of companies that are
    expected to grow at a rate faster than the market average. Stocks of
    these companies rarely pay dividends, instead reinvesting corporate
    earnings for further research and development. These businesses tend
    to have greater upside potential, but also greater risk and
    volatility. Small-cap stocks, which often represent strong growth
    potential, are held within the portfolios of these funds.

-   **Income stock funds** invest in dividend-paying companies,
    stressing steady income over appreciation. These funds might include
    preferred stocks, blue chip stocks, and utility stocks.

-   **Growth and income funds**, also known as **combination funds**,
    include some stocks for growth and others that pay high dividends.

######### Other Categories of Stock Funds {#other-categories-of-stock-funds .unnumbered}

> **International funds** and **global stock funds** invest in stocks
> issued by companies located throughout the world. Global funds can
> also include stocks in US companies. Some of these funds invest in
> companies located in emerging-market countries, which can increase
> both risk and potential reward. Some stock funds invest in only a
> specific geographic region, such as Europe or the Pacific rim.
>
> Rather than diversifying their holdings, **sector funds** or
> **specialty funds** concentrate their assets in a particular industry,
> such as technology or healthcare. These funds present more risk than
> funds with greater sector diversification because one year's top
> sector could crash the following year. They are most appropriate for
> investors who are interested in a particular industry but who want to
> spread risk among numerous companies within the sector.

######### Suitability of Stock Funds {#suitability-of-stock-funds .unnumbered}

> Stock funds are most appropriate for investors seeking long-term
> growth through capital appreciation, although dividends and capital
> gains may also supply income for investors that have an income
> objective. Stock funds should be considered for investors that can
> tol- erate the normal ups and downs of the stock market. They are an
> important core portfolio component for delivering growth that can help
> keep pace with inflation.
>
> Preferred stock funds, utility stock funds, and blue chip stock funds
> help supply income because of their steady dividends. Like bond funds,
> these stock funds are often used to satisfy the needs of investors
> that specify a current income objective.
>
> ***[4.2.4.4 Bond Funds]{.underline}***
>
> **Bond funds**, also called **fixed-income funds**, are professionally
> managed portfolios that invest in corporate and government bonds for
> the purpose of providing income to investors. The income paid by the
> fund to investors as dividends represents interest earnings from the
> bonds held in the portfolio.

######### Categorization of Bond Funds {#categorization-of-bond-funds .unnumbered}

> A bond fund's stated objective is generally focused on a particular
> sector, such as corporate or Treasury bonds, or a broad investment
> strategy category, such as investment-grade or high-yield.
>
> Common categories of bond funds include:

-   **US government bond funds** invest primarily in bonds issued by the
    US Treasury or federal government agencies, and thus offer low
    credit risk to investors. Because of their higher level of safety,
    their yields and total returns are lower than those of other bond
    funds.

-   **Corporate bond funds** buy bonds issued by corporations ranging
    from large, well- established firms to small companies. The riskier
    choices may deliver higher yield but will also have greater
    volatility.

-   **High-yield bond funds**, also known as **junk bond funds**, invest
    in untested companies as well as in bonds of well-known companies
    that have weakened

> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

######## Securities {#securities-7 .unnumbered}

> financially. They hold below investment-grade debt that has a higher
> potential of default on interest payments, resulting in higher yields.

-   **Municipal bond funds**, also known as **tax-exempt bond funds**,
    invest in the bonds issued by municipalities. The income generated
    is free from federal income taxes, and may also be exempt from state
    and local taxes depending on the bond's origination and the
    investor's state of residence. These funds are most appropriate for
    high-net-worth investors in a high tax bracket.

> Bond funds are also categorized by the time horizon of the bonds held
> in the portfolio, ranging from short-term (i.e., less than a year) to
> long-term (i.e., between 10 and 30 years). Funds with longer average
> maturities may experience the greatest volatility, or fluctuation in
> NAV. Like individual bonds, the value of a bond fund will move
> inversely with interest rates.
>
> Longer-term bond funds are particularly vulnerable to changes in
> interest rates, but will provide higher yield. Short-term bond funds
> may be most appropriate for investors with low tolerance for changes
> in share value but who require income.

######### Suitability of Bond Funds {#suitability-of-bond-funds .unnumbered}

> Normally bond funds are identified by whether they can satisfy a
> specific income need. They are often included in a portfolio to boost
> an investor's total return by providing steady income.
>
> Though usually safer than stock funds, bond funds face their own
> risks, including default risk, interest rate risk, and reinvestment
> rate risk.
>
> ***[4.2.4.5 Asset Allocation Funds]{.underline}***
>
> ![](media/image9.png){width="2.6804057305336833in"
> height="2.0077373140857393in"}**Asset allocation funds** invest in a
> combination of asset classes, including stocks for growth, bonds for
> income, and cash or cash equivalents for safety and liquidity,
> providing portfolio diversification. A portfolio manager is typically
> given some discretion to adjust the mix as market conditions change.
> The mixture of securities and allocations will also differ by how
> aggressive the fund is in generating growth and returns. An example of
> an asset allocation fund is below.
>
> ***[4.2.4.6 Index Funds]{.underline}***
>
> **Index funds** are the only type of mutual fund that is not actively
> managed. Instead, the fund purchases most, or all, of the securities
> contained in a specific index, such as the S&P 500, with the intention
> of delivering the same performance as that index. Once the portfolio
> is assembled, it is not actively managed. Although these funds will
> not beat the market in performance, the risk of underperformance
> relative to the benchmark index tends to be low.
>
> Because there is little trading activity, index funds cost less for
> investors than other funds, as they have relatively low management
> fees. Additionally, they are generally more tax-efficient because less
> of their trading activity generates taxable capital gains.

######### [Mutual Fund Share Value]{.underline} 

> Mutual fund shares are offered through **continuous primary
> offerings**. Shares are gener- ally available for purchase without
> limit, meaning the fund will create brand new shares for any customer
> who wants to invest. Investors in mutual funds have an undivided
> interest in the fund's portfolio, which means that their ownership
> interest represents a proportionate share of each and every portfolio
> security. Persons who purchase an interest own shares of the mutual
> fund, and each share fluctuates in value based on changes in the
> market price of all the securities that comprise the portfolio.
>
> The value of shares is calculated from the fund's **net asset value
> (NAV)**. As mentioned, the NAV of a mutual fund is equal to the
> company's total assets minus its total liabilities. For example, if an
> investment company has total assets of \$100 million and total
> liabilities of \$20 million, the investment company's NAV will be \$80
> million. Because an investment compa- ny's assets and liabilities
> change daily based on market fluctuation, the NAV also changes daily.
> NAV might be \$80 million one day, \$100 million the next, and \$90
> million the day after.
>
> Open-end funds must calculate their NAV at least once every business
> day, typically after the major US exchanges close. The NAV of a single
> share is determined by dividing the fund's NAV by the number of shares
> outstanding. For example, if a mutual fund has an NAV of \$100
> million, and investors own 10 million of the fund's shares, the fund's
> per-share NAV will be
>
> \$10. Most mutual fund valuations are expressed on an NAV-per-share
> basis.
>
> The net asset value of the fund's shares does not change when new
> shares are sold. The additional cash that flows into the fund is
> offset by the new shares that have been issued. Likewise, the NAV per
> share does not change when shares are redeemed. The cash that flows
> out of the fund is offset by there being a smaller number of shares.
> However, if a mutual fund pays out a distribution to investors (e.g.,
> a dividend), NAV will decrease, as the fund is distributing cash to
> shareholders.
>
> ***[4.2.5.1 Purchase and Redemption of Mutual Funds]{.underline}***
>
> Investors that purchase mutual funds pay the NAV per share plus any
> sales charge the fund imposes. The amount paid by investors when
> purchasing shares is known as the **public offering price (POP)**,
> which is calculated as:
>
> When shareholders wish to sell their shares, they are redeemed by the
> fund. In other words, mutual funds register a continuous offering of
> **redeemable shares**, meaning there is no secondary market for mutual
> funds. If an investor wants to purchase shares, the fund will create
> brand new shares for him to buy, and if an investor wants to sell
> shares, they are sold to, or redeemed by, the issuing fund. Mutual
> fund shares cannot be sold to other investors in the secondary market.
>
> The price that investors receive on redemption is the NAV per share
> less any fees, such as redemption fees or deferred sales charges. When
> fund shares are purchased or sold, the price that applies is the price
> as of the next NAV calculation. This is known as **forward pricing**.
>
> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

> Additionally, when an investor purchases mutual funds, the investor
> must put up 100% of the necessary cash. Mutual funds cannot be
> purchased on margin, i.e., with borrowed funds. However, once an
> investor has held shares of a mutual fund for at least 30 days, those
> shares have loan value, which means an investor can use the mutual
> fund shares as collateral to buy other securities on margin.
>
> ***[4.2.5.2 Mutual Fund Sales Charges, Fees, and
> Expenses]{.underline}***
>
> When investors buy mutual fund shares, a sales charge, also called a
> **sales load**, generally applies. This fee compensates the sales
> person for the expertise required to select the appro- priate fund for
> the customer. Funds may have a front-end, back-end, or level sales
> charge, depending on the type of share class purchased.
>
> A mutual fund's sales charge is expressed as a percentage of the
> public offering price (POP).
>
> ***Example***
>
> Fund XYZ has an NAV of \$19 and a POP of \$20.16. To calculate the
> dollar amount of the sales charge, use the following calculation:
>
> Sales Charge = \$20.16 POP -- \$19 NAV Sales Charge = \$1.16
>
> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

######## Securities {#securities-11 .unnumbered}

> To calculate what percentage the sales charge is of the POP:

**Sales Charge % =**

> **Public Offering Price**

| > Sales Charge %    | > =   | > \$20.16 POP -- \$19 NAV             |

|                     |       | > \$20.16 POP                         |
+---------------------+-------+---------------------------------------+

> Sales Charge % = 5.75%
>
> The maximum front-end sales charge is 8.5% of the POP for funds that
> do not charge 12b-1 fees---**12b-1 fees** are annual fees that cover
> the mutual fund's marketing and distribution expenses. A fund can only
> charge the maximum sales charge if certain privileges are offered to
> shareholders, which will be discussed shortly.
>
> The maximum 12b-1 fees for all types of mutual fund shares is 0.75% of
> a fund's average net assets. Additionally, if a fund wants to
> advertise itself as a no-load fund, which means it does not charge a
> sales charge, it cannot charge 12b-1 fees of more than 0.25% of the
> average net assets. The 12b-1 fee must be originally approved and
> annually approved by both sharehold- ers and the fund's board of
> directors.
>
> Fees are an important consideration for investors when investing in
> any type of mutual fund, because they reduce the fund's total return.
> It is good practice to understand why fees are high or low relative to
> those of similar funds. Sometimes higher fees are justified because
> the funds produce higher returns; other times there is little
> justification.
>
> The fund's fees can be compared through a calculation called the
> **expense ratio**, which must be prominently disclosed in the fund's
> prospectus. The expense ratio is calculated as:

+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+
|               | > **Management Fees + Operating Expenses**           |
+===============+======================================================+

+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+
|               | > **Average Annual Net Assets**                      |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+

> An expense ratio of 1% means that, each year, 1% of the fund's total
> assets will be used to cover expenses.
>
> Actively managed funds generally have an expense ratio of 0.5%--1.0%,
> though some are higher. For index funds, the ratio is usually 0.25% or
> less.
>
> ***[4.2.5.3 Fund Share Classes]{.underline}***
>
> Some mutual funds offer investors different types of shares, known as
> **share classes**. A multi- class structure offers investors the
> ability to select a fee and expense structure that is most appropriate
> for their investment goals and investment time horizons.

-   **Class A shares** normally have **front-end sales charges** paid at
    the time of the initial purchase. They also tend to have a lower
    12b-1 fee than other share classes. Class A shares offer
    **breakpoints**, which are discounts off the sales charge based on
    the dollar amount invested. Front-end loads may be beneficial for
    investors who

> intend to hold their shares for more than several years, as well as
> those making large purchases who want to benefit from breakpoints.

-   **Class B shares** have a **back-end** or a **contingent deferred
    sales charge (CDSC)** that is paid when investors redeem their
    shares within a specified number of years. Class B shares typically
    impose a 12b-1 fee that is higher than Class A shares.

> Additionally, Class B shares do not offer breakpoints. These shares
> are typically good for investors with little investment cash and a
> long investment horizon.
>
> The table below shows a typical B-share CDSC schedule:

+--------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+
| > **Year**   | > 1   | 2     | 3     | > 4   | > 5   | 6     | > 7+ |
+==============+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+======+
| > **Charge** | > 5%  | 4%    | 3%    | > 3%  | > 2%  | 1%    | > 0  |
+--------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+

-   **Class C shares** have a level-load sales charge. They typically
    have relatively high 12b-1 fees, other annual expenses, and either a
    front- or back-end sales load, thus these shares generally have the
    highest annual expense charges. They are designed for people who
    want to make short-term mutual fund investments. If the shares are

> held for a longer term, the fees get higher. Similar to Class B
> shares, they do not offer breakpoints.

-   **No-load funds** are mutual funds that are sold at their NAV,
    without any sales charge added. In other words, the NAV and the POP
    are the same. No-load funds are usually purchased directly from the
    fund management company rather than from an outside broker or
    distributor. Although on the surface no-load funds seem like the
    "better deal" for mutual investors, many people benefit from the
    advice of an outside broker in helping to determine the most
    suitable fund for their investment objectives. However, a fund with
    high costs must perform better than a low-cost

> fund to generate the same returns for a shareholder. Index funds are a
> good example of funds that are no-load.

> ***4.2.5.4 Mutual Fund Pricing Features***
>
> As previously noted, mutual funds may charge a maximum sales charge of
> 8.5%. However, to qualify for this maximum sales charge, mutual funds
> must offer three features, which allow for the reduction of sales
> charges under certain circumstances. The three features are
> breakpoints, rights of accumulation, and automatic reinvestment of
> dividends at NAV. Funds that do not offer these three features can
> charge a maximum sales charge of 6.25%, though competitive forces
> often drive these sales charges lower.
>
> ***4.2.5.5 Breakpoints***
>
> **Breakpoints** allow investors to qualify for discounts off the sales
> charge based on the amount of money invested within a mutual fund. The
> fund discloses its breakpoint schedule in its prospectus. The chart
> below illustrates a typical breakpoint chart:

+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| > **Amount Invested**                  | > **Sales Charge**          |
+========================================+=============================+
| > Under \$50,000                       | > 5.75%                     |
+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| > \$50, 000 to \$99,999                | > 4.50%                     |
+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| > \$100,000 to \$249,999               | > 3.50%                     |
+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| > \$250,000 to \$499,999               | > 2.50%                     |
+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

> For example, using the breakpoint schedule above, a customer investing
> \$350,000 would have a 2.5% sales charge on the entire purchase. Note
> that breakpoints are not incremental and instead apply to the entire
> purchase.
>
> Registered representatives should always help customers understand the
> advantages of breakpoint discounts. In fact, FINRA prohibits
> representatives from attempting to earn a
>
> higher commission by encouraging the sale of mutual fund shares at an
> amount just below the point where a sales charge is reduced. This
> prohibited practice is termed a **breakpoint sale**.
>
> Additionally, instead of investing all the cash at once to achieve a
> breakpoint, an investor can sign a **letter of intent (LOI)**. A
> letter of intent (LOI) is a type of contract offered by a mutual fund
> in which an investor agrees in writing to purchase a specified amount
> of mutual fund shares over the next 13-month period. The sales charge
> applied on each purchase is based on the promised total investment.
>
> For example, using the sample breakpoint table above, assume an
> investor plans to invest
>
> \$125,000 in a mutual fund over the next 13 months, with an initial
> investment of \$10,000 today. The sales charge on the first purchase
> and on all subsequent purchases is 3.50%, instead of 5.75%.
>
> Investors can also backdate a letter of intent for a period of 90 days
> to reduce the sales charge on a prior purchase. The same LOI can also
> be applied to reduce the sales charges of purchases for accounts of
> spouses and minor children.
>
> If the investor does not complete the purchase specified within the
> LOI, the otherwise appli- cable sales charge will apply. The fund
> holds the additional shares purchased due to the reduced sales charge
> in an escrow account, and will liquidate these shares to pay the
> higher sales charge. Appreciation in share value and reinvestment of
> dividends and capital gains do not count toward completion of an LOI.

> ***[4.2.5.6 Rights of Accumulation]{.underline}***
>
> **Rights of accumulation** offer investors an additional opportunity
> to receive a reduced sales charge based on the amount of money
> invested in one mutual fund. It's important to note that, under rights
> of accumulation, the sales charge discount is only available on
> subsequent purchases. It does not apply to initial transactions.
>
> ***Example***
>
> If a customer has already invested \$23,500 in a mutual fund that has
> a breakpoint at
>
> \$25,000, and then chooses to invest another \$2,000, the customer
> would receive the lower sales charge on the additional \$2,000
> investment, because the total position now exceeds
>
> \$25,000.
>
> Additionally, under rights of accumulation, investors can use share
> appreciation and rein- vested dividends to compute the value to which
> new purchases are added when the sales charge discount is determined;
> also, there are no time limits.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Ten years ago, a customer invested \$13,000 into a mutual fund. Over
> the 10-year period, the customer's initial investment appreciated to
> \$23,500. Assuming the fund has a breakpoint of \$25,000 and the
> customer chooses to invest another \$2,000, the customer would receive
> the lower sales charge on the additional \$2,000 investment.
>
> Breakpoint discounts can also apply to **combination purchases**. This
> means that custom- ers can aggregate their investments within the same
> mutual fund group or family of funds for the purpose of reducing the
> sales charge. For example, an investor can combine investments made in
> three separate Fidelity Mutual Funds (e.g., Fidelity growth fund,
> Fidelity income fund, and Fidelity small-cap fund) to meet a
> breakpoint and receive a reduced sales charge.
>
> Additionally, spouses and minor children can combine their investments
> into the same fund to receive a reduced sales charge.
>
> ***[4.2.5.7 Fund Reinvestments at NAV]{.underline}***
>
> Mutual funds make periodic distributions to their shareholders of
> dividends, interest, and capital gains. Shareholders may elect to
> receive these distributions in cash, or they may reinvest them in the
> fund for the purchase of additional shares. When the fund allows these
> reinvestments at the NAV, the investor pays no sales charge on that
> new purchase. This fea- ture is referred to as **automatic
> reinvestment privileges** and must be offered to investors along with
> breakpoints and rights of accumulation in order for the fund to be
> eligible to charge the maximum sales load.

######### [4.2.6 Share Purchase and Redemption Violations]{.underline}  {#share-purchase-and-redemption-violations .unnumbered}

> When advising customers on mutual fund strategies, registered
> representatives must be aware of certain prohibited practices. These
> include:

-   **Late trading** occurs when purchase or redemption orders are
    received by the mutual fund after the close of business and are
    filled at that day's price rather than at the next day's price. This
    is prohibited, as it could provide an information advantage for the
    investor receiving the shares because after-close news could be

> considered. In most cases, NAVs are calculated at 4:00 pm, ET, which
> means that all orders received after that time must be filled based on
> the NAV calculated on the next business day, as required by forward
> pricing.

-   **Switching** is when a registered representative moves a customer
    from one mutual fund to another fund that has a similar investment
    objective for no legitimate investment purpose. Sometimes referred
    to as **churning**, this practice is a violation, as it creates
    additional transaction costs as well as potential tax liabilities
    for the investor. For example, it would be considered inappropriate
    to recommend an investor liquidate a Fidelity growth fund and move
    the proceeds into a Janus growth fund with almost identical
    investment objectives.

-   **Selling dividends** is a prohibited sales practice where a
    registered representative sells a mutual fund to an investor right
    before the fund pays out a dividend. This is a violation because the
    dividend distribution will decrease the NAV of the recently

> purchased shares and result in a tax event for the customer. Instead,
> the customer is better off investing into the fund at the lower NAV
> after the dividend has been paid to avoid the *immediate* tax
> liability.
>
> ***Example***
>
> A mutual fund has an NAV of \$10 and is about to pay a \$1 dividend.
> Once the dividend is paid, the NAV will drop by the amount of the
> dividend---to \$9. If investors purchase the shares right before the
> dividend is paid, they will pay \$10 to purchase the shares, and when
> the dividend is paid they will receive the \$1 dividend, and the value
> of their shares will decrease to \$9. Because they will be required to
> pay tax on the \$1 dividend, investors are better off avoiding the tax
> liability by investing at the lower NAV of \$9 after the divi- dend
> distribution has been made. The investor will then keep the \$1 in his
> pocket without paying any tax.

#### Progress Check---Solutions {#progress-checksolutions-3 .unnumbered}

1.  (**B**) Mutual funds are open-end investment companies. They freely
    create and redeem shares to meet market demand. Open-end means there
    is no limit on the number of shares they can create.

2.  (**D**) There is no secondary market or exchange-trading of mutual
    fund shares. Rather, shares must be bought directly from and sold
    back to the issuer of the fund.

3.  (**D**) In choosing a mutual fund, the investment adviser is the
    most important entity to evaluate. The adviser is responsible for
    investing cash and securities, day-to-day trading, and setting
    overall investment strategy.

4.  (**A**) The SEC prohibits mutual funds from selling securities
    short, buying securities on margin (with borrowed funds), or
    participating in joint investment or trading accounts.

5.  (**C**) Money market mutual funds aim to maintain a constant net
    asset value of

> \$1 per share. Note that the net asset value can fluctuate above or
> below \$1 per share, though this is typically a rare occurrence.

6.  (**D**) Index funds are a type of mutual fund that is not actively
    managed, as it instead purchases most (or all) of the securities
    held in a popular index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.
    Index funds aspire to deliver performance in line with the index.
    They generally have low management fees.

7.  (**A**) In mutual funds, the main driver of change in NAV is the
    performance of securities held in the fund portfolio. NAV changes
    each day to reflect the net assets of the fund divided by shares
    outstanding. Changes in the number of shares outstanding do not
    impact NAV.

8.  (**C**) A sales charge is paid once, at the time of purchase.
    Management fees and 12b-1 fees are continuous over the duration of a
    fund holding. CDSC can be continuous also, but it gradually declines
    and phases out over a period of several years.

######  Closed-End Funds

> As discussed, there are two types of management companies, open-end
> funds (aka mutual funds) and closed-end funds. Our discussion will now
> focus on the features of **closed-end funds (CEFs)**. It is important
> to understand both the differences and similarities between these
> management company funds.

######### Similarities to Mutual Funds

> Closed-end funds are professionally managed investment companies that
> offer investors many of the same advantages as mutual funds,
> including:

-   Professional management

-   Diversification

-   Affordability

-   Liquidity

> Similar to mutual funds, closed-end funds make distributions to
> investors, including capital gains and dividends.

######### Unique Features of Closed-End Funds

> Although there are similarities between mutual funds and closed-end
> funds, it is extremely important to understand the differences between
> them.
>
> ***[4.3.2.1 Issuance of Closed-End Fund Shares]{.underline}***
>
> As discussed, mutual funds have a constantly changing pool of capital.
> They experience constant inflows of cash through their continuous
> primary offerings of new shares. They also have constant outflows of
> cash due to their obligation to redeem shares within seven days of
> request.
>
> Closed-end funds, however, are comprised of a stable pool of capital.
> The number of shares available and the total invested capital in a
> closed-end fund is fixed, unless the fund chooses to make an
> additional public offering in the future. The name "closed-end fund"
> is derived from the fact that both the capital structure and number of
> shares are generally fixed.
>
> Closed-end funds originally issue shares through an initial public
> offering, much like any other company that goes public. They sell
> shares to raise capital, which is then invested on behalf of investors
> by the fund's manager. Following this IPO, the shares are traded in
> the secondary market on an exchange between investors. Unlike with
> mutual funds, there is investor-to-investor trading of closed-end fund
> shares, and the shares are not redeemed by the fund.
>
> Because closed-end funds do not redeem shares, they do not need to
> maintain ready liquid- ity for shareholders that want to sell their
> shares back to the fund. This is advantageous because closed-end fund
> managers are not forced to sell securities in a declining market to
> meet redemptions.
>
> ***4.3.2.2 Pricing of Closed-End Funds***
>
> Similar to mutual funds, closed-end funds calculate a net asset value.
> However, unlike mutual funds, closed-end funds are not required to
> make the NAV calculation daily, as the price at which shares are
> bought and sold by investors is set by the market forces of supply and
> demand. Investor perceptions about the market cause the shares of
> closed-end funds to fluctuate away from the NAV in secondary-market
> trading.

> ***Example 1***
>
> Fund XYZ has an NAV of \$10 per share and a POP of \$9 per share. Fund
> XYZ is a closed- end fund because closed-end funds can trade at an
> offer price either above or below the NAV. Fund XYZ cannot be a mutual
> fund, as mutual funds are offered at the NAV plus a potential sales
> charge.
>
> ***Example 2***
>
> Fund XYZ has an NAV of \$10 per share and a POP of \$11 per share.
> Fund XYZ can be either a closed-end fund or a mutual fund, as both can
> trade above the NAV.
>
> ***Example 3***
>
> Fund XYZ has an NAV of \$10 per share and a POP of \$10 per share.
> Fund XYZ can be either a closed-end fund or a mutual fund, as both can
> trade at the NAV. A mutual fund will be offered at the NAV if it is a
> no-load fund.
>
> ***4.3.2.3 Purchasing Closed-End Fund Shares***
>
> Because closed-end funds are exchange-traded products, a commission is
> paid for the ser- vices provided in both purchase and sales
> transactions. Unlike mutual funds, closed-end funds do not charge a
> sales charge or 12b-1 fees.
>
> Closed-end funds do carry an annual **expense ratio**. This charge is
> reported in the fund's prospectus and annual report. These fees are
> very important to understand, as they reduce the investment
> performance achieved by the fund.
>
> Additionally, closed-end fund shares, unlike mutual funds, can be
> purchased on margin, meaning with borrowed funds.

> ***[4.3.2.4 Exchange Trading of Closed-End Shares]{.underline}***
>
> The procedures for buying and selling closed-end fund shares are the
> same as those for stocks. The current price of the shares fluctuates
> throughout the day as determined by mar- ket forces, and the shares
> can trade at a premium or at a discount from the NAV, as previously
> discussed. Investors can effect transactions by submitting market
> orders for immediate execution or setting price parameters through
> limit or stop orders, which will be discussed in a later chapter. The
> process, from order entry to execution, can take just minutes. This is
> a major difference between closed-end fund shares and mutual fund
> shares: while closed- end fund shares trade throughout the day, all
> orders in mutual fund shares are placed at the close of business,
> based on the day's closing net asset value.
>
> ***4.3.2.5 Raising Capital for Closed-End Funds***
>
> Another significant difference between the two types of funds is the
> raising of capital. Closed- end funds are permitted to issue **senior
> securities**, such as preferred stock or bonds, as well as borrow
> money to leverage and increase their investment positions. This
> additional flexibility gives portfolio managers of closed-end funds
> the potential to enhance yield and provide investors with higher
> returns. In comparison, mutual funds can only issue common shares, not
> senior securities, and they cannot use leverage.

###### Unit Investment Trusts

> **Unit investment trusts (UITs)** are another investment company
> regulated under the 1940 Act. One of the main characteristics that
> distinguishes UITs from open-end and closed-end funds is that UITs are
> not actively managed. This feature, as well as the other attributes of
> UITs, will be discussed in this section.

######### [Structure of a UIT]{.underline} 

> The creation of a UIT involves the drafting of the **trust
> indenture**, by the fund's sponsor, which initiates the formation of
> the trust. In the indenture, the sponsor names a trustee to handle the
> administrative duties. These include responsibility for custody of the
> securities owned by the UIT; recordkeeping for the investors; and
> accounting and tax reporting for the portfolio. UITs differ from other
> investment companies in that they do not have a board of directors,
> corporate officers, or investment advisers.
>
> ***[4.4.1.1 Portfolio Composition]{.underline}***
>
> Similar to management investment companies, UITs will have an
> established investment objective, and the securities they purchase are
> chosen to accomplish that objective. For example, the sponsor can
> build various types of fixed-income UITs, such as portfolios con-
> sisting of corporate, international, agency, and municipal bonds, as
> well as equity UITs, which can include a wide range of stocks.
>
> Once securities are selected and assembled, the UIT portfolios are
> supervised for the life of the trust and units are sold through
> brokerage firms to investors.
>
> Although the securities within a UIT are generally not traded, the
> sponsor may remove a security from the trust or purchase new
> securities under limited circumstances. These situations are outlined
> in the prospectus and include circumstances such as the following:

-   A severe decline in credit rating

-   Bankruptcy

-   Fraud, or

-   A requirement to sell securities due to a merger or acquisition

> An advantage of a fixed portfolio is that it allows investors to know
> what securities are held within a UIT through the life of the trust.
> There will be no "style drift" in the portfolio strat- egy. Investors
> will find the exact portfolio securities held by the UIT listed in its
> prospectus.
>
> The other benefit of this fixed portfolio is that UITs are often
> substantially cheaper than mutual fund shares because no fee for
> active management exists.
>
> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

######## Securities {#securities-19 .unnumbered}

> ***[4.4.1.2 UIT Termination]{.underline}***
>
> Unlike a mutual fund, a UIT is created for a specific length of time
> and has a termination date that is established at the time of
> creation. The termination date is related to the securities that are
> held in the trust. In the case of a UIT investing in bonds, for
> example, the termina- tion date may be determined by the maturity date
> of the bond investments, perhaps 20 to
>
> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

######## Securities {#securities-20 .unnumbered}

> 30 years. UITs that invest in stocks may seek to capture capital
> appreciation over a period of a year or a few years.
>
> The UIT is dissolved and is no longer active when it reaches its
> termination date. Any remain- ing portfolio securities are sold, and
> proceeds are distributed to investors.

######### Purchasing and Selling UIT Units

> When a UIT is created, units of the trust are first sold to investors
> in an initial public offering. Representatives that sell new units in
> UITs are legally required to provide to prospective investors a
> prospectus, which highlights the fees, such as sales charges and
> certain operating expenses.
>
> ***[4.4.2.1 Redemption of Units]{.underline}***
>
> Although UITs are designed to be bought and held by their purchasers
> until the trust ter- minates, investors can sell their holdings back
> to the issuing investment company. Early redemptions of units will be
> paid based on the current underlying value of the holdings. Similar to
> mutual funds, UITs are priced at the end of each business day.
>
> There is no guarantee that the amount an investor receives at
> redemption will equal what would have been received if the units were
> held to maturity. The redemption price may be more or less than the
> original purchase price.
>
> Some UITs permit investors to exchange their holdings for a different
> UIT at a reduced sales charge. This flexibility may be attractive when
> an investor's investment objectives change.
>
> Units of a new trust are only offered once, during the initial public
> offering. Investors that want to add to their UIT investment may be
> able to do so by obtaining additional units when there have been
> redemptions.
>
> ***[4.4.2.2 UIT Performance Measurement]{.underline}***
>
> The performance of UITs is measured similarly as the performance of
> mutual fund shares. Like those of mutual funds, UIT prices are
> determined by the net asset value of the underly- ing securities in
> the fund. This value rises and falls with the value of the underlying
> invest- ments. However, when calculating the total return of the
> investment, the NAV is only part of the equation---dividends and
> capital gains must also be taken into account.

######### Suitability of UITs

> Unit investment trusts offer several features that benefit investors
> more than if they were to invest in individual securities. For
> example, a UIT can pay monthly dividends, which can be taken in cash
> or reinvested into more shares of the UIT, allowing the earnings to
> compound. These highly predictable distributions are one of the
> primary advantages of UITs.
>
> Also, the sponsor of a UIT will buy back units at the current net
> asset value if an investor needs to cash out of the investment early.
> The set termination date of a bond UIT means
>
> that the sponsor can calculate an accurate expected yield from the
> investment, allowing investors to do long-term planning.
>
> Investors always know exactly what they own when they invest through a
> UIT. Some inves- tors find comfort in that the securities and
> management style of the UIT do not change throughout its life.
>
> UITs offer an attractive opportunity for investors to own a portfolio
> of securities that is typically liquid with a low minimum investment.
> Because the portfolio is fixed, the cost of the investment is
> typically lower than that of other packaged products. Also, the
> absence of active trading in the portfolio creates great tax
> efficiency. There are almost no unexpected or unwanted capital gains
> distributions, except under unusual circumstances.

1.  ***Risks of UITs***

> Generally speaking, unit investment trusts may not be appropriate for
> investors seeking capital preservation. The portfolios take on the
> risk of the underlying securities. There is no assurance that an
> individual UIT portfolio will meet its objective.
>
> UITs are not actively managed and are not sold to take advantage of
> market conditions. Upon termination, there is no assurance that the
> value of the UIT will be equal to or higher than the original price.
>
> The level and type of risk associated with UITs may vary significantly
> from one trust to another. To know the risks, it is important to have
> a complete understanding of the under- lying securities from which a
> UIT derives its value. The investment strategies and risks of each UIT
> are fully outlined in the trust's prospectus.

###### Exchange-Traded Funds

> **Exchange-traded funds (ETFs**) are another type of investment
> company. Although ETFs can legally be established as either UITs or
> open-end funds, their characteristics make them a unique hybrid of all
> the types of investment companies that have previously been discussed.

######### [Features of ETFs]{.underline} 

> ETFs are designed to closely track the performance of a specific
> sector, market benchmark, or index. For example, popular ETFs hold the
> same stocks as major indices, such as the S&P 500 or Dow Jones
> Industrial Average. Bond ETFs might track issuers from a specific
> sector or a specific region. Other ETFs track the value of
> commodities, such as the price of gold and oil.

2.  ***Passive Investment Vehicles***

> It's important to note that ETFs, similar to UITs, are passive
> investment vehicles; they are not actively managed to outperform the
> current market. Typically, the only time the portfolio of an ETF will
> change is if the underlying index changes. For example, in 2013 when
> Facebook was added to the S&P 100 and S&P 500, all the ETFs tied to
> those benchmarks had to buy Facebook stock to add to their portfolios.
> Otherwise, whatever is in the portfolio generally remains in the
> portfolio.
>
> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

######## Securities {#securities-21 .unnumbered}

> *Chapter 4* Investment Company

######## Securities {#securities-22 .unnumbered}

> One advantage of this passive strategy is that ETFs are typically a
> lower-cost option for inves- tors because of their lower expense
> ratios and tax-efficient nature. Additionally, because the portfolio
> of an ETF is not actively traded, ETFs have low portfolio turnover.
> This creates greater tax efficiency, as realized capital gains are
> minimized.
>
> ETFs have become incredibly popular in recent years, and as their
> focus becomes more specialized, some may become more actively managed.
> However, the focus on the exam is on ETFs as a passive vehicle.
>
> ***[4.5.1.2 Trading ETFs in the Secondary Market]{.underline}***
>
> As their name implies, ETFs are exchange-traded. The procedures for
> buying or selling ETFs are the same as for buying or selling stocks.
> Like closed-end funds, the share price of an ETF is determined by
> supply and demand. The shares can trade at either a premium or at a
> dis- count from the NAV, since the current market price of the shares
> will fluctuate throughout the day as determined by market forces.
>
> ETFs allow investors to use different types of trading strategies that
> apply to other securities purchased in the secondary market, such as
> short-selling and buying on margin. Shares can also be purchased or
> sold through advanced orders like stop and limit orders. As with
> closed-end funds, investors pay commissions when purchasing or selling
> shares of an ETF.

######### [Advantages and Disadvantages of ETFs]{.underline} 

> As discussed, ETF features combine many attractive benefits for
> investors. Because port- folios are supervised, rather than actively
> managed, the costs of ETF investments are typi- cally lower than those
> of management investment companies. The absence of active trading also
> reduces an investor's tax liability, as fewer capital gains will be
> realized. Additionally, because shares of an ETF are actively traded
> in the secondary market, between investors on exchanges, they are
> extremely liquid, as they can be sold at any time throughout the day.
>
> Of course, ETFs also have their disadvantages. Even though they do not
> charge manage- ment fees, investors must still pay commissions when
> purchasing these shares, which can negatively impact returns.
> Additionally, the fact that the shares are extremely liquid might lead
> investors to overtrade their positions, especially when the market is
> performing poorly, which is not always the best investment
> strategy---it creates timing risk and results in increased commission
> payments. Finally, the lack of active professional management means
> that the returns of an investor's ETF will be consistent with the
> market, but will not beat that benchmark.

> Notes:

-   ETFs may have active management but in most cases it is
    passive---i.e., index-tracking. Unit trusts are not managed.

-   Only mutual funds have a continuous offering of new shares; all
    other investment companies have a one-time offering for a fixed
    number of shares.

-   Breakpoints only apply in mutual funds because the other types of
    investment companies lack front-end sales charges.

> *Chapter 4:* Investment Company Securities

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-3 .unnumbered}

1.  (**C**) Some mutual fund shares have a sales charge, most of which
    is passed through to a brokerage firm for providing professional
    service and advice. Breakpoints enable investors to qualify for a
    discount in the sales charge by buying shares in large quantities.

2.  (**D**) Mutual fund investors do not know the exact price at which
    their shares will be redeemed. The price is usually the
    next-calculated net asset value (NAV). If there is a CDSC, it is
    subtracted from NAV. Since NAV is calculated at least once per day,
    investors don't have to wait more than a day to find out.

3.  (**A**) All investors must receive a summary prospectus when they
    make their initial purchase of a mutual fund's shares. The full
    prospectus is available *on request*. For most investors, the
    summary prospectus is the most readable and understandable document.

4.  (**B**) Mutual funds contract with a transfer agent to handle
    customer transactions such as issuing, redeeming, and cancelling
    fund shares and making distributions of dividends and capital gains.

5.  (**C**) When a mutual fund reports that it has returned 10.5% over
    one year, for example, that figure has three components. The most
    important is the change in NAV from the

> start of the year to the end. The others are dividend payments and the
> annual capital- gain distribution, both of which reduce NAV.
> Unrealized gains and losses on the fund's portfolio securities are
> reflected in NAV.

6.  (**B**) Money market mutual funds are suitable for investors seeking
    safety, price stability, and a high degree of liquidity. As no-load
    funds, they also can be economical to own. However, they pay very
    little current income.

7.  (**D**) Money market deposit accounts at banks are covered by FDIC
    insurance, up to a limit. But money market mutual funds are *never*
    covered. This is a very important point for investors to understand
    because the names of these products are similar and easily confused.

8.  (**D**) US government bond funds invest primarily in bonds issued by
    the US Treasury or federal government agencies, so they hold the
    safest bonds.

9.  (**C**) Mutual fund shares cannot be purchased on margin. However,
    their value can be used as collateral to increase the buying power
    of margin accounts. Mutual fund shares acquire this loan value when
    they are purchased in a margin account and held for at least 30
    days.

10. (**D**) The expense ratio calculation adds management fees and
    operating expenses and then divides the total by average annual net
    assets. The management fee is paid to the fund's investment adviser
    and expressed as a percentage of assets under management, such as
    1%. Operating expenses include ongoing fees paid for recordkeeping,
    custodial services, legal costs, and accounting.

#### Unit Exam---Solutions (Continued) {#unit-examsolutions-continued-3 .unnumbered}

11. (**C**) A breakpoint sale is a serious regulatory offense. It occurs
    when a broker solicits or recommends a sale just below a breakpoint
    that would qualify the investor for a quantity discount on the sales
    charge.

12. (**C**) Closed-end funds offer many of the same benefits as mutual
    funds: professional management, diversification, affordability,
    liquidity. However, they do not create and redeem their own shares
    to meet demand. A fixed number of shares are issued, and these
    shares then trade in the secondary market, like stocks. Closed-end
    funds calculate and publish NAVs, but they are not subject to the
    same daily NAV calculation requirement as mutual funds.

13. (**A**) Because closed-end funds are exchange-traded, they can trade
    at a discount or premium to NAV based on supply and demand for the
    shares.

14. (**C**) One benefit of closed-end funds is that they trade on
    exchanges, just like stocks. The same types of limit and stop orders
    that are used for stocks can be useful with closed- end funds. A
    "buy at NAV" order does not exist, and if he enters a market order,
    the price will be at the best available market price. A limit order
    to buy at \$16.50 or better will get him what he wants, if that
    price becomes available.

15. (**C**) The biggest advantage of ETFs over index mutual funds is the
    ability to buy, sell, or trade shares intraday by placing regular
    orders (market, limit, etc.). This is because ETFs are
    exchange-traded, whereas mutual funds are only redeemable with the
    issuer.

16. (**B**) Only unit investment trusts (UITs) have both fixed
    termination dates and fixed portfolios. ETFs begin with fixed
    portfolios and then rebalance or reconstitute the portfolios to
    align with changes in the underlying index. However, ETFs do not
    have fixed termination dates.

### Other Managed Products

> Besides investment company securities, a number of other packaged
> securities allow inves- tors to receive the benefits of professional
> and active management. Many of these products are suitable only for
> sophisticated investors, though some, such as real estate investment
> trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs), are suitable
> for a wider range of investors. These investments generate **passive
> income**, i.e., the earnings derived from an enterprise in which the
> investor is not actively involved.
>
> This chapter will discuss some additional types of managed products,
> including real estate investment trusts, direct participation
> programs, limited partnerships, and hedge funds.

####### Chapter Goals {#chapter-goals-4 .unnumbered}

-   Know the 75-75-90 test for REITs as well as their trading
    characteristics.

-   Compare the tax structure of REITs and DPPs.

-   Contrast the roles of the limited and general partners.

-   Distinguish between a master limited partnership versus a regular
    limited partnership.

-   Identify who hedge fund and private equity investing is suitable
    for.

-   Know how a municipal fund security differs from a mutual fund.

####### Key Terms {#key-terms-4 .unnumbered}

-   **Real estate investment trust (REIT)**---An actively managed pool
    of capital that invests in real-estate-related assets, combining
    professional management, diversification, exchange-trading, and tax
    benefits

-   **Pass-through vehicle**---An investment vehicle, such as a direct
    participation, that pays out all income and losses to investors,
    therefore avoiding double taxation of earnings

-   **Direct participation program (DPP)**---A business entity, for
    example, a limited partnership, that passes through all gains and
    losses to investors, therefore avoiding double taxation of earnings

-   **Limited partnership (LP)**---A type of direct participation
    program, which includes investments from general partners, who
    actively manage and take full liability for the business, as well as
    limited partners, who have limited liability and are not involved in
    day-to-day management

> *Chapter 5* Other Managed

######## Products {#products .unnumbered}

-   **Master limited partnership (MLP)**---A special type of limited
    partnership that is publicly traded

-   **Hedge fund**---A professionally managed investment vehicle that
    uses aggressive trading strategies to generate higher returns at the
    risk of heightened losses and is therefore typically only
    appropriate for sophisticated, high-net-worth individuals and
    institutional investors

-   **Exchange-traded note (ETN)**---An unsecured debt instrument whose
    return is tied to the performance of an equity security or market

-   **Municipal fund security**---A pool of invested capital, similar to
    a mutual fund, that is issued by a government entity

###### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)

> A **real estate investment trust (REIT)** owns and operates
> income-producing real estate or real-estate-related assets. Modeled
> after mutual funds, REITs provide a way for individual investors to
> receive diversification and a share of income produced from commercial
> real estate ownership without actually buying and holding properties.
> Instead they receive a proportionate share of distributions from the
> pool of assets based on the amount of their ownership. In effect,
> REITs offer a liquid, dividend-paying means of participating in the
> real estate market.
>
> The income-producing real estate assets that are owned by a REIT may
> vary widely, although most specialize in a single type of real estate.
> Commonly owned assets include office build- ings, shopping malls,
> apartments, hotels, resorts, self-storage facilities, warehouses, and
> mortgages or loans.
>
> REITs can provide important diversification benefits for investors due
> to their relatively low correlation with other assets, including
> stocks and bonds. This diversification can help improve returns
> without increasing overall portfolio volatility.
>
> The unique investment characteristics of income-producing real estate
> provide REIT inves- tors with competitive long-term rates of return
> that complement other asset classes that may be held in their
> investment portfolios.

######### [Structure of REITs]{.underline} 

> The IRS specifies requirements for the investment of REIT assets and
> the pass-through of income they generate:

-   At least 75% of a REIT's total assets must be invested in real
    > estate.

-   At least 75% of a REIT's gross income must be derived from rents or
    > mortgage interest.

-   On an annual basis, REITs must distribute at least 90% of their
    > taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.

> *Chapter 5* Other Managed

######## Products {#products-1 .unnumbered}

######### Trading Characteristics

> Like other publicly traded corporations, REITs raise capital by
> offering shares to the public through an initial public offering. The
> shares represent an interest in the assets that are managed, enabling
> the REIT to buy, develop, and manage real estate. The shareholders
> elect a board of directors, who is responsible for choosing the
> investments and for hiring a team to manage those investments on a
> daily basis.
>
> Following the IPO, shares of large, publicly traded REITs may be
> listed on exchanges. Although REITs have a net asset value (NAV), as
> with closed-end funds, the shares may trade at a discount or premium
> to NAV, based on market supply and demand.
>
> Among the fundamental factors that influence the value of a REIT's
> real estate holdings are the balance in supply of new buildings and
> the demand for new space. If new construction is available in the
> market more rapidly than it can be sold, building vacancy rates
> increase, rents can weaken, and property values decline. This results
> in a decrease in the net asset value of a REIT. Alternatively, the
> value of the shares will rise when property values and occupancy rates
> increase.

######### Public and Private REITs

> **Publicly traded REITs** trade on major exchanges and offer investors
> the liquidity and transparency advantages of publicly traded stock.
> Usually investors can purchase a publicly traded REIT's common stock,
> preferred stock, or debt securities via a broker-dealer.
>
> In addition to publicly traded REITs, there are **public non-traded
> REITs**. Non-traded REITs are distributed through broker-dealers and
> are generally illiquid. While potential returns may be very
> attractive, investor funds may be unavailable for a long
> time---periods of eight years or more are not uncommon. Early
> redemption of shares is limited, and fees associated with the sale of
> these products can be high.
>
> Both publicly traded and non-traded REITs are subject to disclosure
> filings, including annual and quarterly reports and an offering
> prospectus that must be filed with the SEC. The key distinction
> between them is that publicly traded REITs are listed on an exchange,
> whereas non-traded REITs are not.
>
> **Private REITs**, or **private-placement REITs**, are generally
> exempt from SEC registration and the disclosure requirements discussed
> above. They can be sold only to accredited inves- tors and
> institutional clients---they do not trade on exchanges. The lack of
> disclosure doc- uments makes it difficult for investors to make an
> informed investment decision, and the lack of liquidity can make them
> inappropriate for many investors.

######### [Types of REITs]{.underline} 

> REITs generally fall into three categories:

-   Equity REITs

-   Mortgage REITs, and

-   Hybrid REITs

> Most REITs today are **equity REITs**. They generate income for
> shareholders by purchasing and operating income-producing commercial
> real estate. Their revenues typically come from the collection of rent
> on the properties they own and from the sales of properties they hold.
>
> **Mortgage REITs** invest in mortgages or mortgage-backed securities
> that are tied to com- mercial and residential properties. Their
> businesses include lending money for mortgages to owners of real
> estate, and purchasing existing mortgages or mortgage-backed
> securities. Their revenues are generated primarily by the interest
> that they earn on the mortgage loans, the profit margin they earn on
> these investments, and the sales of mortgages they hold.
>
> **Hybrid REITs** combine the investment strategies of equity REITs and
> mortgage REITs by investing in both real properties and debt
> instruments secured by mortgages on real estate. A hybrid REIT
> generates income from rent and capital gains, like an equity REIT, as
> well as interest income, like a mortgage REIT.

######### Suitability of REITs

> REITs offer investors a number of benefits, including:

-   **Diversification**---REIT returns have shown less correlation with
    the returns of the broader stock market, which have made them
    valuable as a portfolio component in down markets.

-   **Dividends**---REITs can provide a consistent income stream to
    investors. In fact, for equity investors with current income as
    their primary objective, REITs are among the most popular choices.

-   **Liquidity**---Exchange-listed REIT shares can be easily bought and
    sold.

> Equity REITs can be well suited for investors seeking income, and for
> long-term investors seeking both income and capital appreciation. For
> investors with a longer time till retire- ment, dividends can be
> reinvested to generate future returns, while in later years they can
> provide a steady income stream to help meet expenses in retirement.
> Equity REITs can provide a natural hedge against inflation because
> over the long run real estate values have historically increased more
> than the inflation rate.
>
> *Chapter 5* Other Managed

######## Products {#products-4 .unnumbered}

> Equity REITs are subject to the same risks that apply to the real
> estate market in general. There may be reduced demand for space in
> economic downturns; property values may fall; rental income may
> decrease. An increase in interest rates may also drive down
> profitability because of increased borrowing costs.
>
> Investors find value in mortgage REITs primarily because of their
> potentially high dividends, which can produce income in excess of many
> other investments. Changes in interest rates can affect REITs' main
> source of earnings as well as the value of their mortgage assets. The
> mortgages they hold may be subject to credit risk and prepayment risk
> from changes in interest rates that will cause borrowers to refinance
> or repay mortgages.
>
> Unlike direct real estate ownership, investing in REITs does not
> provide tax shelter benefits, as they do not pass through losses to
> investors.

###### Direct Participation Programs (DPPs)

> **Direct participation programs (DPPs)** are investment vehicles that
> allow investors to participate directly in the cash flows and tax
> benefits of the underlying entity without hold- ing an active
> management role in the business. The term "direct participation
> program" originates from the Securities Act of 1933, and both the SEC
> and FINRA regulate the com- pensation, fees, and expenses in the
> public offerings of these programs.
>
> Of the managed investments discussed in this chapter, DPPs are one of
> the few that can potentially serve as tax shelters. This means that
> investors participate not only in income and gains distributions from
> the underlying investments, but also in losses that they can use to
> reduce certain types of taxable income. Consequently, investors
> potentially owe less tax as a result of investment loss pass-through.
> However, there are limitations to this tax-shel- tering benefit,
> specifically that passive losses can only be used to offset passive
> gains. Put
>
> differently, an investor cannot use the losses from a DPP to offset
> ordinary income or capi- tal gains. Therefore, the primary factor in
> choosing a DPP investment should be economic soundness, not tax
> benefit. However, if tax benefits are available, investors in these
> programs should make use of them. Investors who do not pay a lot of
> taxes generally should not invest in DPPs.
>
> *Chapter 5* Other Managed

######## Products {#products-5 .unnumbered}

> Despite the tax-sheltering benefits, DPPs have significant risks
> associated with them. They frequently operate as **blind pools**,
> seeking investments without disclosing the underlying securities. With
> this structure, investors cannot evaluate the investment's risks or
> potential returns. DPPs are also highly illiquid investments; there is
> no guarantee of a secondary mar- ket. For these reasons, DPPs are
> generally suitable only for sophisticated investors.

######### [DPP Business Structures]{.underline} 

> Only certain business types can be structured as direct participation
> programs. The most common form of business structure for DPPs is the
> **limited partnership (LP)**, in which there are two different types
> of partners. **General partners** actively manage the business and
> usually have personal liability along with all management authority.
> **Limited partners** play a passive role in the business---they do not
> participate in any management or day-to- day decisions. The tradeoff
> for the passive role they play is protection from personal liability
> for the debts or obligations of the partnership. Like shareholders in
> a corporation, limited partners are liable only to the extent of their
> ownership interest. In other words, their per- sonal assets are
> protected from any legal actions or loss that their incorporated
> business may face. This feature of **limited liability** can make
> limited partnerships an attractive invest- ment opportunity.
>
> Examples of limited partnerships include hedge funds (discussed later
> in this chapter), oil and gas programs, and real estate programs.

######### [Forming a Limited Partnership]{.underline} 

> Establishing a limited partnership requires a **partnership
> agreement**. This agreement identifies the names and roles of the one
> or more general partners, who have management authority and personal
> liability, and the one or more limited partners, who are passive
> inves- tors with no management authority. All partners---both general
> and limited---must be given a copy of the partnership agreement, which
> also defines how the partnership will function, how decisions will be
> made, and conditions under which changes to or dissolution of the
> partnership will occur.

######### [The Roles of the Partners]{.underline} 

> The general partners, or managing partners, of an LP have a number of
> specific duties and rights. These include:

-   The right to bind the partnership into legal contracts and take on
    > debt on behalf of the partnership

-   The right to accept or reject new limited partners

-   The right to charge a management fee for overseeing the partnership

-   The right to determine the timing and amount of cash distributions

-   Fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interest of the limited
    > partners when investing capital and managing the partnership

-   The duty to settle accounts upon dissolution of the partnership

> In addition, because of their active role in the business, general
> partners are subject to cer- tain restrictions on their activities.
> They cannot:

-   Borrow money from the partnership or commingle personal funds with
    > those of the partnership

-   Compete against the partnership for personal gain, and

-   Continue the partnership after the departure of another GP unless
    > the partnership agreement has authorized the activity

> The roles and rights of limited partners include:

-   Providing capital to the business as passive investors

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Liability that is limited to the extent of their investment

-   The right to inspect books and records of the partnership

-   The right to sue the GP if actions are taken that are not in the
    best interest of the partnership, and

-   The right to vote on significant changes to the partnership

> This voting right available to limited partners is called an
> **exercise of the partnership democracy**. It is used on an infrequent
> basis, and only for special circumstances, such as admitting a new GP,
> contesting a judgment against the GP, the sale or refinancing of
> partner- ship property, or permitting a GP to take action that is
> contrary to the partnership agreement.
>

######### [Dissolution of the Limited Partnership]{.underline} 

> The dissolution date of the partnership is generally established in
> the partnership agree- ment. On this date, the partnership is
> cancelled and the manager settles the account. The order of priority
> of claims against the partnership is as follows:

-   Secured lenders

-   Other general creditors (e.g., unsecured lenders)

-   Limited partners

-   General partners

######### [Taxation of Limited Partnerships]{.underline} 

> When businesses meet IRS qualifications as limited partnerships,
> economic events of the partnership flow through to the partners:

-   Income

-   Gains

-   Losses

-   Deductions (i.e., depletion and depreciation)

> The partnership itself is not a tax-paying entity. Instead, each
> partner pays taxes based on their share of the pass-through income.
> This is in contrast to normal corporations, which must pay taxes at
> the corporate level, resulting in the disadvantage of double taxation
> of dividend income.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Apple is a traditional subchapter C corporation, subject to double
> taxation. When Apple earns income, it pays income tax at the federal
> corporate tax rate. An investor who owns Apple stock will also be
> required to pay tax on any dividends received. Therefore, investors
> are subject to double taxation. The benefit of a direct participation
> program is that there is no corporate taxation. Only the individual
> partners pay taxes.

######### [Master Limited Partnerships]{.underline} 

> **Master limited partnerships (MLPs)** are limited partnerships
> offered to the public and traded on exchanges. MLPs are particularly
> common in industries such as natural resources, financial services,
> and real estate. They may have hundreds of limited partner investors,
> and they provide investors with the advantage of freely transferable
> interests and limited liabil- ity---much like a corporation, but
> without their dividends being subject to double taxation.

#### Progress Check---Solutions {#progress-checksolutions-4 .unnumbered}

1.  (**C**) Public REITs, master limited partnerships (MLPs), and
    exchange-traded funds (ETFs) usually have active secondary markets
    through exchange-trading. Limited partnerships (LPs) do not. That
    makes LPs less liquid than other types of managed products.

2.  (**A**) To achieve tax pass-through status, REITs must pass three
    tests: 75% of total assets must be invested in real estate, 75% of
    gross income must be derived from real estate, and at least 90% of
    taxable income must be distributed to shareholders.

3.  (**D**) Pass-through status allows the REIT to avoid paying income
    tax at the entity level. All tax obligations are passed through the
    entity to investors. This avoids the double taxation of earnings
    that corporations normally face (one tax at the entity level;
    another at the investor level).

4.  (**B**) To achieve tax pass-through status, REITs must pass three
    tests: 75% of total assets must be invested in real estate, 75% of
    gross income must be derived from real

> estate, and at least 90% of taxable income must be distributed to
> shareholders. There is no profitability test.

5.  (**B**) Direct participation programs (DPPs) allow investors to
    participate in the profits and losses of a business entity without
    having active involvement in the business.

6.  (**B**) Many DPPs are offered to investors as blind pools, meaning
    their specific business activities or holdings have not yet been
    identified. This can be a significant risk factor, increasing
    opacity and complexity for investors, especially those who are not
    sophisticated.

7.  (**D**) There are two types of partners in a limited partnership.
    General partners, of which there must be at least one, manage the
    business and usually have personal liability along with all
    management authority. Limited partners play a *passive* role, not
    participating in management decisions and having liability that is
    limited to the amount they invested.

8.  (**C**) All limited partnerships require a partnership agreement,
    which identifies the names and roles of the general and limited
    partners and binds them together.

###### Hedge Funds

> \$150 million in assets must now register with the SEC.
>
> All hedge funds are subject to the same prohibitions against fraud as
> other market partici- pants, and their managers owe a fiduciary duty
> to the investors in the funds they manage.

######### [Investment Strategies]{.underline} 

> The fundamental investment objective of hedge funds is to protect or
> "hedge" against market declines and produce consistently positive
> returns. They have broad authority to invest in any type of
> security---even non-securities and tangible investments such as real
> estate--- while employing sophisticated investing and trading
> strategies. They can contribute returns that are not closely
> correlated to global stock and bond markets, providing diversity to an
> investor's portfolio. Hedge funds accomplish this through investment
> strategies that offer both increased opportunity and heightened risk.
>
> For example, hedge fund managers regularly take short positions in
> securities and use bor- rowed cash to magnify returns (thus employing
> leverage). While these strategies can be highly profitable, they
> present potential risks beyond those of traditional mutual funds.
> Short positions of securities can lose an unlimited amount of money in
> rising markets. In contrast, a long position can fall no further than
> zero. Leverage, or using borrowed money, can also dramatically magnify
> losses and force fund managers to sell in falling markets to meet
> margin calls on borrowed securities.

######### [Purchasing Hedge Funds]{.underline} 

> Minimum investment amounts are set by each hedge fund. They are
> typically high dollar, with many of the best-known hedge funds
> starting at minimums of \$1 million for purchases.
>
> Most hedge funds are open-ended, allowing investors to add or withdraw
> funds on a monthly or quarterly basis. An investor owns a share of the
> hedge fund's net asset value, which increases and decreases with the
> value of the fund's investment assets less its expenses.
>
> ***[5.3.3.1 Lock-Ups]{.underline}***
>
> Hedge funds often require investors to commit to periods of
> illiquidity, called **lock-up peri- ods**. The hedge fund lock-up
> provision is defined as the time during which an investor may not make
> a withdrawal from the fund. The lock-up period protects the majority
> of assets in the fund from liquidation and allows portfolio managers
> to keep a lower amount of cash on hand.

######### [Suitability of Hedge Funds]{.underline} 

> Because of the unique risks of hedge fund investing, investors should
> carefully read the fund's prospectus and related materials. Investors
> should understand the increased level of risk involved in the
> investment strategies these fund managers employ, and ensure that the
> risks are suitable based on personal investing goals, time horizons,
> need for liquidity, and risk tolerance. Investors should recognize
> that with the higher potential returns comes greatly magnified risks.

> improving the company's performance, the private equity firm takes the
> company public and "cashes out" or attempts to generate large returns
> through a company sale.

######### Role of the Manager

> The manager of the private equity firm is in charge of making the
> investment decisions on behalf of the fund. The management team
> conducts all the research, or due diligence, to qualify potential
> companies in which to invest. The investors in the private equity fund
> play a passive role in the investment selection process. The money
> manager receives compensa- tion that is similar to a hedge fund
> manager's---an annual management fee (usually 2% of the invested
> capital) and a portion of the fund's profits (typically 20%).

######### Risks of Private Equity

> Private equity plays an important role in the markets because it
> fosters liquidity and entre- preneurship, and creates shareholder
> value. It can add jobs and stimulate economic growth. However, private
> equity is one of the riskiest investments available because many
> companies fail or underperform. Private equity investors must be
> willing to take significant long-term risks for what can be very high
> returns.
>
> Therefore, investments in private equity funds are typically only
> available to and suitable for wealthy individuals or institutional
> investors who can afford to commit large sums of money for long
> periods of time.

###### Structured Products

> The term **structured product** refers to an investment product that
> produces a return based on the performance of one or more underlying
> securities or markets. The underlying asset could be a single
> security, a basket of securities, an index, a commodity, a bond, or a
> foreign currency. Because their value is derived from the performance
> of an underlying asset, these products can be referred to as
> **derivatives**.
>
> Structured products generally include some guarantee or limit on
> downside exposure. To generate income and to provide the downside
> protection, these products usually rely on derivative investments and
> option strategies. A wide variety of structured products are avail-
> able; some are straightforward, but others use highly complex
> structures that have been tailored for a particular issue.
>
> The structured product that SIE candidates need to be familiar with
> are exchange-traded notes (ETNs).

######### Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs)

> An **exchange-traded note (ETN)** is a type of unsecured corporate
> debt that is typically issued by a broker-dealer. It combines two
> elements: a bond for the protection of principal makes up most of the
> investment, and the remainder is put into a derivative to provide
> equity exposure. The bond element ensures that the investor's
> principal will be protected, as long as the issuer does not default,
> while the derivative element offers the potential to boost returns
> based on the performance of the underlying equity. ETNs do not pay
> interest, so if the underlying equity (represented by the derivative
> piece) declines in price, an investor will only receive back their
> principal at the instrument's maturity, but with no additional
> returns. Put differently, the investor gets to share in the upside of
> the equity, but not the downside.
>
> From a suitability perspective, because exchange-traded notes are debt
> obligations of the issuing broker-dealer, investors should consider
> that firm's creditworthiness prior to invest- ing. Additionally, even
> though ETNs can be exchange-traded, because they are a relatively new
> product, liquidity may still be somewhat limited, especially compared
> to that of other exchange-listed securities.

1.  ***ETNs and ETFs Compared***

> Below are key points about ETNs versus ETFs that candidates should
> know:

-   Both are exchange-traded products. However, as mentioned, the
    secondary market for ETNs is much more limited, making them less
    liquid than ETFs.

-   ETFs actually own the securities in their portfolios, whereas ETNs
    are unsecured debt instruments. ETNs' performance is based on an
    underlying security, but they do not actually own that security.

-   Because ETFs track an index and are not created using complex
    products, they are more suitable for a wider range of investors than
    ETNs.

###### Municipal Fund Securities

> MSRB Rule D-12 defines **municipal fund securities** as investment
> "pools" similar to mutual funds but that are instead issued by a state
> or local government entity. Like a mutual fund, the investment pool is
> a collection of investments from many investors. Professional man-
> agers invest and operate the fund's capital to produce capital gains
> and income for investors based on a defined investment objective.
>
> Unlike standard municipal securities, municipal fund securities are
> not debt securities. Rather, they are equity securities; investors own
> a share in the investment pool. This is sim- ilar to how investors in
> a mutual fund own a proportionate share of the fund's underlying
> investments. This section will focus on one particular type of
> municipal fund security---local government investment pools (LGIPs).
> Other types will be discussed in a later chapter.

######### [Local Government Investment Pools (LGIPs)]{.underline} 

> **Local government investment pools (LGIPs)** are established by state
> or local govern- mental entities to serve as a vehicle for investing
> public funds held by these entities. Their overall purpose is to
> provide safe, liquid, and competitive investment options for eligible
> local-government investors.
>
> The money invested by these participating jurisdictions is managed by
> either government employees or an external investment-management firm.
> For example, a state may establish an LGIP that is managed by its
> state treasurer. Typically, the cash of participating jurisdic- tions
> is invested in securities allowed under state laws. Through the
> pooling of their funds, government participants receive many of the
> same benefits as mutual fund investors, includ- ing economies of
> scale, portfolio management, diversification, and liquidity.

1.  ***Investment Objectives***

> The management of LGIPs depends on the established investment
> objectives. When LGIPs were first created in the late 1980s, they
> resembled money market mutual funds, attempt- ing to meet the
> objective of stability and liquidity for investors by investing in
> short-term securities to avoid market risk as much as possible. They
> are appropriate for governmental entities that require liquidity with
> little tolerance for price volatility. The majority of LGIPs follow
> this design.
>
> Other government investment pools have investment objectives of
> maximizing returns.
>
> *Chapter 5* Other Managed

######## Products {#products-14 .unnumbered}

> These pools invest in longer-term securities that have a greater
> potential for investment growth. Investors are subject to market and
> liquidity risk.

2.  ***Regulation***

> LGIPs function very much like mutual funds. However, because they are
> technically munic- ipal securities, they are regulated by the MSRB and
> not subject to SEC registration or regu- lation under the Investment
> Company Act of 1940. For example, unlike mutual funds, these do not
> require issuers to prepare a prospectus and statement of additional
> information, calculate net asset value on a daily basis, or establish
> a board of directors with independent directors.

3.  ***Marketing***

> In most situations, LGIP securities are marketed directly to potential
> participants. Each fund provides information, often through the LGIP's
> website, to assist participants in understand- ing the pool's
> objectives and operations.
>
> LGIPs may also engage a municipal securities firm to provide marketing
> services. In this case, the dealer is required to receive from the
> issuer a copy of an **official statement**, which must be provided to
> the governmental investor at or before settlement of the transaction.

4.  ***Fees and Charges***

> As with mutual fund investments, fees and charges affect the total
> return on LGIP invest- ments, as the LGIP may charge annual or other
> miscellaneous charges. Additionally, any investment-management firm
> engaged by the LGIP will usually charge a fee based on the assets
> under management. These fees are paid out of the assets in the pool,
> reducing current returns and share values.
>
> If LGIP shares are sold by municipal securities dealers, a commission
> or sales charge may also apply.

| 1.  False---The price to buy shares in a publicly traded REIT is the  |
|     > net asset value per share. **The price can be either a premium  |
|     > above NAV or a discount below NAV. It is set by the market and  |

|     > publicly traded REITs can be good investments for IRAs. **Since |
|     > IRAs are tax-sheltered, REIT shares held in IRAs pay dividends  |

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-4 .unnumbered}

1.  (**B**) REITs pass through income (from rents or mortgage interest)
    and capital gains. By law, they are not allowed to pass through
    capital losses. Any portfolio losses will generally be reflected in
    a lower NAV and price per share.

2.  (**C**) One advantage of publicly traded REITs is that they trade in
    active secondary markets, like stocks. Investors can buy a few
    shares, hold as long as they wish, and then sell on an exchange.
    Buying a few shares can be a good way for investors to learn more
    about REITs.

3.  (**A**) Private REITs can only be sold to accredited investors and
    institutional clients. They do not trade on exchanges, which means
    they are difficult to value and have low liquidity. These
    investments can be illiquid and fairly high-risk.

4.  (**D**) Private REITs are complex investments only available to
    sophisticated investors, but in some ways they are most like the
    experience of buying a home for long-term appreciation. They are
    generally illiquid (like homes) and have long-term holding periods.

5.  (**C**) The REIT world is divided into two camps. Equity REITs buy
    properties and hope to profit from their rents and price
    appreciation. Mortgage REITs make real estate loans or hold
    real-estate-related debt instruments. Hybrid REITs combine the
    characteristics of both.

6.  (**A**) Limited partners are silent investors in an LP. They do not
    have an active role in the partnership. However, they still maintain
    certain rights including the right to inspect the books and records
    of the partnership and to sue the general partner if they do not act
    in the best interests of the partnership.

7.  (**C**) Partners (limited and general) stand behind lenders and
    creditors in a dissolution. Remember that general partners always
    stand last in line, even behind limited partners.

8.  (**A**) MLPs are exchange-traded limited partnerships. They invest
    in many of the same activities as LPs, such as oil and gas drilling
    and real estate. However, they are traded on exchanges like stocks.
    Investors can buy or sell as many shares of MLPs as they want,
    fairly easily. The tax benefits are the same in LPs and MLPs.

9.  (**C**) Two and twenty is a common management-fee structure in hedge
    funds. The management fee is a flat 2% of assets annually. The
    manager also earns 20% of profits as a performance fee.

10. (**D**) Mutual funds are generally simpler, more transparent, and
    more economical than hedge funds. In today's market, mutual funds
    pursue many of the same strategies as hedge funds. The biggest
    difference is that mutual funds are prohibited from engaging in
    short sales and using large amounts of leverage. These strategies
    are common in hedge funds.

11. (**D**) A lock-up provision restricts an investor from requesting
    withdrawals of capital from the fund. In this case, the investor
    would not be able to touch capital contributed to the fund during
    the first three years. If an unexpected need for cash arises, money
    would need to be accessed elsewhere.

#### Unit Exam---Solutions (Continued) {#unit-examsolutions-continued-4 .unnumbered}

12. (**B**) Private equity firms seek to add value to companies by
    improving their strategies or management teams. They usually need to
    own the whole company (or the great majority of shares) to achieve
    this. They also may need years to execute the turnaround strategy
    and realize profit in an exit event---e.g., taking the company
    public or finding a buyer.

13. (**A**) Exchange-traded notes (ETNs) have many of the same features
    as exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, they have a different
    structure because they are notes (debt instruments) backed by the
    issuer. As notes, they have a maturity date at which the ETN will be
    liquidated.

14. (**B**) LGIPs allow local governments to pool their cash into
    vehicles similar to mutual funds.

> However, unlike mutual funds, which are regulated by the Investment
> Company Act of 1940 and the SEC, LGIPs are municipal securities
> regulated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).

15. (**C**) LGIPs are municipal securities subject to the regulation of
    the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). The issuer is
    required to prepare a disclosure document called an official
    statement. A copy must be given to investors at or before settlement
    of the transaction.

16. (**A**) Exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are unsecured debt instruments
    with returns tied to the performance of a security or market. In
    addition to market risk, they also have credit risk tied to the
    issuer's credit profile. One risk of investing in ETNs is that the
    issuer could default.

### Options

> Options are financial instruments that provide investors an
> opportunity to speculate on changing prices or to protect existing
> positions. An **option** is a **derivative** contract because its
> value is derived from the price of another asset, called the
> **underlying asset**. Options contracts bind two parties, who agree to
> standardized terms and conditions. All options contracts have a
> **buyer** and a **seller**, with each party bearing certain **rights**
> and **obligations**.
>
> This chapter will discuss the different types of options contracts,
> the risks and opportuni- ties for buyers and sellers, and strategies
> involved in the options marketplace. Candidates should expect a
> combination of both narrative and scenario-based questions as well as
> mathematical questions.

####### Chapter Goals {#chapter-goals-5 .unnumbered}

-   Describe the basic features of an options contract.

-   Compare the rights, obligations, and attitudes of option buyers and
    sellers.

-   Calculate maximum gain, maximum loss, and breakeven for each option
    position.

-   Understand how to use options to hedge a long-stock or short-stock
    position.

-   List the components of an option premium, and calculate intrinsic
    value.

-   Determine profit or loss when option positions are exercised,
    expired, or liquidated.

-   Know the role of the Options Clearing Corporation.

####### Key Terms {#key-terms-5 .unnumbered}

-   **Call option**---An options contract that gives the purchaser the
    right to buy stock at a fixed price and obligates the seller to sell
    the stock at a fixed price if the contract is exercised

-   **Put option**---An options contract that gives the purchaser the
    right to sell stock at a fixed price and obligates the seller to buy
    the stock at a fixed price if the contract is exercised

-   **Premium**---The cost of an options contract, which is paid by the
    buyer, who is purchasing the right to do something, and received by
    the seller, who is taking on the obligation to do something

> *Chapter 6*

######## Options {#options-1 .unnumbered}

-   **Time value**---The portion of an option's premium that reflects
    the time remaining until expiration

-   **In-the-money**---The situation in which an option has exercisable
    value, which for call options occurs when the market value is above
    the strike price and for put options when the market value is below
    the strike price

-   **Out-of-the-money**---The situation in which an option has no
    exercisable value, which occurs for call options when the market
    value is below the strike price and for put options when the market
    value is above the strike price

-   **Uncovered call (or naked call)**---The riskiest options position,
    where an investor sells a call option without owning the underlying
    stock and therefore, if the contract is exercised, must purchase the
    shares in the market, regardless of how high the price has gone up,
    and then sell them at the fixed strike price

-   **Covered call**---A conservative options position where an investor
    sells a call option while owning the underlying stock, generating
    income for the investor at the cost of potentially losing the upside
    appreciation of his shares if the option is exercised and he is
    forced to sell

-   **Hedge**---When an investor takes a position with an opposite
    outlook and attitude to protect an existing investment

-   **Closing transaction**---When an investor liquidates her option
    position and exits the market by either repurchasing an option she
    originally sold or selling an option she originally purchased

-   **Buyers** are also described as **owners** or **holders** of
    options contracts, or as being

> **long** an options contract.

-   **Sellers** are also described as **writers**, or as being **short**
    an options contract. These terms apply to buyers and sellers of both
    calls and puts.

> Buyers can *choose* to take advantage of their contractual rights,
> while sellers are *obligated* to perform. A buyer that chooses to take
> advantage of these rights **exercises** the option contract. When an
> option is exercised, the seller does not have any choice in the

> **Number of contracts**---Each option position indicates how many
> contracts were bought or sold. In this example, the investor bought
> one option contract. The **contract size** for option contracts is the
> number of shares of the underlying asset that can be bought or sold
> through the contract. For equity options, the **standard contract
> size** of one contract is **100 shares**.
>
> **Underlying asset**---The option derives its value from the
> underlying asset. This exam focuses on equity options, where the
> underlying asset is stock. Other types of underlying assets include
> indices, foreign currencies, volatility, and interest rates. Calls and
> puts on all under- lying assets function basically the same.
>
> Examples of underlying assets:

-   Stock (IBM or AAPL)

-   An index (the S&P 500)

> **Expiration**---Each option contract has a predetermined expiration,
> or termination date. Once the contract expires, the buyer is no longer
> entitled to exercise the contract, and the seller is no longer
> obligated to perform. An option's expiration is set at the time the
> contract is issued and does not change.
>
> **Strike price (i.e., exercise price)**---The strike price is the
> price at which holders can buy (long calls) or sell (long puts) the
> underlying asset until the contract expires.
>
> **Class**---Class describes all options of the same type (calls or
> puts) and issuer. All the call options on an underlying stock are one
> class. Similarly, all the put options of a single issuer are one
> class.
>
> ***Example***
>
> All of the call options on IBM---regardless of differences in strike
> price or expiration date--- are the call class.
>
> **Series**---An option series describes all call or put contracts in
> the same class with identical strike prices and expiration dates. For
> example, an October 80 call and an October 80 put are of the same
> series. The illustrative table below shows premiums for a series of
> options. This particular chart shows two classes (calls and puts) with
> nine series in each class.

> **Calls or puts are the "class."**
>
> ![](media/image10.png)Each price represents the "premium" (discussed

>
> ![](media/image10.png)Each row and column is a different "series." The
> Oct 90 puts are one series, the Oct 100 puts are another series, and

> **Premium**---The cost of an option contract, which the option buyer
> (holder, owner) pays the option seller (writer) when the contract is
> purchased. The buyer pays this upfront cost for the right to buy
> shares (long call) or sell shares (long put) at the strike price. The
> premium paid by the buyer represents proceeds received by the seller
> for accepting the obligation to sell shares (short call) or buy shares
> (short put) at the strike price.

> The premium is expressed as a cost per share, so the total cost to the

> ***Example***
>
> An ABC Jan 43 call option is quoted with a premium of 4. To purchase

###### Call Option Concepts

> Both buyers and sellers of calls can be profitable in the market.
> However, they profit under different market conditions based on their
> contractual rights and obligations.

+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| > **Position**           | > **Market View**                         |
+==========================+===========================================+
| > Long call (buy, own)   | > Bullish (want market value to increase) |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| > Short call (sell,      | > Bearish (want market value to fall)     |
| > write)                 |                                           |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

> The buyer (owner or holder) of a call contract has the legal **right**
> to buy shares of the under- lying stock at the **strike price**. If
> the buyer chooses to take advantage of this right, the contract is
> **exercised**.
>
> Whether a call option is exercised depends on the relationship of the
> current market value to the strike price:

-   If the current market value is *greater than* the strike price, the
    call option will be exercised. A call is **in-the-money (ITM)** when
    the market value of the underlying stock is above the strike price.

-   If the current market value is *less than* the strike price, the
    call option will *not* be exercised*.* A call is **out-of-the-money
    (OTM)** when the market value of the underlying stock is less than
    the strike price.

-   If the current market value is equal to the strike price, the option
    will generally not be exercised, as there is no economic benefit to
    doing so. This is referred to as being **at-the-money**.

> To summarize, options contracts are **exercised** when they are
> **in-the-money**. They **expire**
>
> worthless when they are **out-of-the-money**.
>
> These terms and their definitions apply to both buyers and sellers of
> calls, meaning whether an investor buys or sells will not impact
> whether the option is in- or out-of-the-money. Instead, a different
> investor response is triggered, as shown in the table below:

######### [Long Call]{.underline} 

> Investors who want the value of stock to increase are **bullish**
> investors. Call buyers are bull- ish because they will profit from a
> rising market price. When the underlying stock appreci- ates, the
> owner of a call will exercise the option and purchase the stock at the
> strike price. At this point, the owner can immediately resell the
> stock at the higher market price.

> ***[6.2.1.1 Long Call Scenarios]{.underline}***
>
> **Jesse buys 1 ABC Jan 50 call at 3**.
>
> This contract allows Jesse to exercise the option and buy shares of
> ABC from her counter- party for \$50 per share until the contract
> expires in January. It is critical to understand when and why Jesse
> would choose to exercise her call option.
>
> **Scenario 1: Market Value of ABC Rises Significantly, to \$60**
>
> If the market value of the underlying stock is **above the strike
> price (i.e., in-the-money)**, the option will be exercised to capture
> the value between the higher current market value and the lower strike
> price.
>
> Therefore, Jesse can exercise her option and purchase 100 shares of
> ABC at \$50 per share and then immediately sell those shares in the
> open market for \$60 per share. She will earn proceeds of \$10 per
> share (\$60 â \$50 = \$10), minus the \$3 per share she paid as
> premium, for a total profit of \$7 per share. Because the contract has
> 100 shares, her total profit on the position is \$700.
>
> **Scenario 2: Market Value of ABC Rises Slightly, to \$52**
>
> If the market value of the underlying stock is **above the strike
> price**---even slightly---call options will be exercised. Described
> differently, the option is still in-the-money. By exercis- ing, the
> investor recoups part of the premium paid. This results in a loss to
> the investor, but the loss is less than if the contract had not been
> exercised.
>
> Jesse will exercise the option and purchase 100 shares of ABC at \$50
> per share and then immediately sell those shares in the open market
> for \$52 per share. She will earn \$2 in pro- ceeds (\$52 â \$50 =
> \$2), minus the \$3 per share she paid in premiums to purchase the
> contract.
>
> Note that Jesse has a loss on her position of \$1 per share because
> her sales proceeds do not recoup the entire premium.
>
> **Scenario 3: Market Value of ABC Falls to \$40**
>
> If the market value is **below the strike price**, the option is
> out-of-the-money. OTM options will not be exercised and will expire
> worthless. The call buyer will realize a loss equal to the amount of
> the premium.
>
> Jesse will not exercise her right to purchase shares of ABC at \$50.
> Why? Because she has no interest in purchasing stock at the strike
> price of \$50 when it is only worth \$40. At expiration, Jesse will
> experience a loss of the premium she paid for the option contract. Her
> premium was \$3 per share, so her total loss is \$300.

> **Erica sells 1 ABC Jan 50 call at 3.**
>
> Erica immediately earns the premium of \$3 per share for a total of
> \$300 (\$3 per share mul- tiplied by 100 shares per contract). As a
> call writer, she hopes ABC stock falls in value and that the option
> expires worthless.
>
> **Scenario 1: Market Value of ABC Rises Significantly, to \$150**
>
> This option is deep in-the-money. Erica's counterparty, the call

> choice in the matter. When the contract is exercised, Erica will be
> forced to sell it at the strike price of \$50 per share (i.e., it is
> "called away"). She will purchase the stock in the open market for
> \$150 per, in order to deliver the shares at \$50. In this
> transaction, she will lose \$100 per share (\$50 â \$150) offset by
> the \$3 per share she earned from the premium. The \$97 per share
> multiplied by the contract size of 100 shares makes for a total loss

>
> This example demonstrates the position and market view of an investor

> ***[6.2.2.2 Selling Covered Calls]{.underline}***
>
> Because of the high risk exposure, writing uncovered options is rarely
> suitable for retail investors. Selling **covered calls** is a more
> conservative strategy, appropriate for a wider array of investors.
>
> In a covered call strategy, an investor owns the underlying stock and
> subsequently writes call options on that security. Investors write
> covered calls to generate income from the pre- miums earned. Investors
> are most likely to deploy this strategy when their market view is that
> the underlying stock will remain flat or neutral over the short term,
> but bullish on the
>
> position over the long term. This is a popular strategy for corporate
> executives who own a significant amount of stock in their own company.
> It allows them to generate additional returns on their portfolio in
> the form of the premiums received.
>
> Covered calls are considered a conservative strategy because the
> position provides (limited) protection or **hedge** against downside
> risk, equal to the amount of the premium earned. However, if the
> underlying stock declines sharply in value, the investor must absorb
> an increasingly large amount of risk.
>
> Covered call writers lose any opportunity to profit when the market
> price of the underlying stock is above the strike price prior to
> expiration. In this situation, the gains in the underlying stock will
> be captured by a long call holder, who will exercise the call.
>
> Investors retain their ability to earn dividends and vote in
> proportion to their shares in a covered call position because they
> retain ownership unless and until they receive an assign- ment.
> However, if the short call is exercised against an investor, the
> investor will be forced to sell his stock and lose any further
> dividends and voting rights.
>
> For the position to be fully covered, the underlying stock must fully
> collateralize the short call---that is, for each options contract
> written, the investor must own 100 shares of stock.
>
> The example below illustrates the mechanics of a covered call
> position.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Hank owns 100 shares of XYZ stock at \$40. To generate some additional
> income in his portfolio, he also writes 1 XYZ Nov 50 call at \$4. By
> selling the call, Hank is limiting his upside on his stock position
> until expiration. No matter how high the stock goes, the short call
> obligates Hank to sell at \$50. Therefore, the most he can make is the
> \$10 difference between the purchase price of his stock, \$40, and the
> strike price of the call, \$50, plus the
>
> \$4 in premiums received, for a total gain of \$14 per share.
>
> Because Hank owns the stock, his worst-case scenario is if the stock
> decreases to zero. In this scenario, he will lose \$40 on the stock,
> though the premium earned provides some downside protection, for a
> total loss of \$36 per share. Finally, because Hank receives the
>
> \$4 premium per share, he can afford his stock to decrease \$4 to \$36
> without losing any money. Therefore, his breakeven is \$36.

>
> John sells 100 shares of ABC Co. short at \$50 per share. To protect
> his position, John also buys 1 ABC Nov 60 call at \$5. If the price of

> However, if the price of ABC increases, no matter how high the price

#### Progress Check---Solutions {#progress-checksolutions-5 .unnumbered}

1.  (**C**) Premiums are paid by option buyers to option sellers. They
    give the buyer the right to exercise the option at a stated strike
    price.

2.  (**C**) In a covered call, an investor sells a call option while
    owning the underlying stock. To be covered, the number of shares
    owned must equal the shares involved in the option. Because Hugo has
    sold three contracts, each worth 100 shares (300 in total), he must
    own at least 300 shares.

3.  (**A**) The seller of a put option is obligated to purchase the
    stock at the strike price if the option is exercised. In this case,
    Gifford is obligated to purchase 300 shares (3 Contracts

> Ã 100 Shares per Contract) at the strike price of \$95 per share.

4.  (**C**) For purposes of determining cash generated or paid out,
    ignore strike prices. Cash is the Premium Ã 100 Shares per Contract.
    She receives \$1,500 by selling five options at a premium of \$3 (5
    Ã 100 Ã \$3). She pays out \$1,200 by buying three options at \$4,

> and she receives the difference of \$300.

5.  (**B**) Options are in-the-money when they are exercisable by the
    buyer. Call options are in-the-money when the market value is above
    the strike price and put options are in-the-money when the market
    value is below the strike price. Ignore premiums for purposes of
    determining when options will be in-the-money or out-of-the-money.

6.  (**C**) Only buyers (not sellers) have the ability to exercise
    options. For option buyers, a call is in-the-money when the stock
    price is above the strike price. It is out-of-the-money when the
    opposite is true. As a call buyer, Sandra can exercise options and
    buy stock worth \$50 for just \$45 per share.

7.  (**D**) In a covered call, the investor sells calls and
    simultaneously holds the same quantity of shares of the underlying
    stock (one option equals 100 shares).

8.  (**C**) For covered call writers, profit is the premium earned plus
    any stock appreciation *up*

> *to the strike price*. In this case, it is \$200 of premium plus \$400
> of potential appreciation, from \$51 to \$55. Covered call writers
> give up any upside above the strike price
>
> because at that point the option will be exercised and the stock
> called away.

###### Put Option Concepts

> Put options, like calls, involve two parties---the buyer and the
> seller. Each can be profitable in the market, but they profit under
> different market conditions based on their contractual rights and

-   A put is **in-the-money** when the market value of the underlying
    stock is below the strike price.

-   A put is **at-the-money** when the market value of the underlying
    stock is equal to the strike price.

-   A put is **out-of-the-money** when the market value of the
    underlying stock is greater than the strike price.

> Investors that want the value of stock to decrease are **bearish**
> investors. Put buyers (holders/ owners/long investors) are bearish and
> will profit from a declining market price. When the underlying stock
> falls in value, the owner of a put will buy the cheaper shares in the

> This is the value proposition of owning put options: the put option

> Long puts are bearish investments because they enable investors to
> profit from a downward price move in the underlying stock. If the

> market, exercise the option, and sell (put) the stock at the higher
> strike price for profit.

> Long puts, like long calls, have a known maximum loss of the premium
> and, therefore, lim- ited financial risk. For these reasons, they are

> When the market value is above the strike price of a put at

> Cora will not exercise her right to sell shares of XYZ at \$30. Why?

######  Index Options

> A protective put can protect a single stock investment or an entire
> portfolio. **Stock index options** are used to provide protection for
> a diversified portfolio. They can protect any unre- alized portfolio
> gains and allow continued appreciation in upside market moves.
>
> Unlike equity options, which are tied to the performance of a single
> underlying stock, **index- based options** derive their value from the
> closing value of an index, such as the S&P 500.
>
> A key difference between equity versus index options is that when
> exercised, equity options have physical settlement, which results in
> the actual purchase or sale of shares of stock. In contrast,
> index-based options settle for cash. No securities change hands;
> instead, cash is delivered when the contract is exercised. The reason
> for this is to avoid the complexity of an investor having to deliver
> one share of every stock on an index.
>
> Although index options have some unique features, these contracts
> offer similar rights to buyers and obligations to sellers. The market
> attitudes of option investors are the same regardless of whether the
> option contract is an equity or a non-equity option contract.
>
> Index options are useful for protecting, or hedging, diversified
> portfolios. Buying options provides the best protection, but costs the
> investor a premium. Selling options has no cost. The premium received
> can add income to the portfolio, but the risk exposure is high.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Mr. Miller has a diversified equity portfolio and would like to limit
> his downside exposure. What index options strategies could hedge this
> risk?

| > If the SPX falls, the puts are in-the-money, and Mr. Miller can     |

| > If the SPX falls, the calls will expire out-of-the-money, and Mr.   |

###### Options Premiums

> The market price of an options contract is its **premium**. Options
> premiums include two components: **intrinsic value** and **time
> value**.

######### [Intrinsic Value]{.underline} 

> The **intrinsic value** of an option is the amount by which it is
> in-the-money. As reviewed previously, the in-the-money calculation
> differs for calls and puts, but it is the same for the buyer/holder
> and seller/writer of each type of option.

+-----------------+----+-------------------------+----+--------------+
| > **Calls**     |    |                         |    |              |
+=================+====+=========================+====+==============+
| > Intrinsic     | =  | > Current Market Value  | >  | > Strike     |
| > Value         |    | > of Underlying Stock   |  â | > Price      |
+-----------------+----+-------------------------+----+--------------+

+-----------------+----+-------------+----+-------------------------+
| > **Puts**      |    |             |    |                         |
+=================+====+=============+====+=========================+
| > Intrinsic     | >  | > Strike    | â  | > Current Market Value  |
| > Value         |  = | > Price     |    | > of Underlying Stock   |
+-----------------+----+-------------+----+-------------------------+

> Intrinsic value cannot be negative, which means that the lowest an
> option's intrinsic value can be is zero. Out-of-the-money options
> always have intrinsic value of zero.
>
> Because the current market value of an option's underlying stock can
> always change, the intrinsic value of in-the-money options contracts
> also changes frequently.

######### [Time Value]{.underline} 

> Time value is the other component of an option's premium. The more
> time until expiration, the higher an option's time value. With a
> longer time horizon, there is greater opportunity for the option to
> move in-the-money. Conversely, as expiration approaches, there is less
> likelihood of a change in the value of the underlying shares. Thus, an
> option's time value quickly declines in its final weeks.
>
> Assume it is June 2018 and ABC has a market value of \$27. Various ABC
> calls with a strike of
>
> \$28 might have premiums as follows:

+---------------------------------------------+------------------------+
| > **Option**                                | > **Premium**          |
+=============================================+========================+
| > ABC Jul 28 call                           | > 0.16                 |
+---------------------------------------------+------------------------+
| > ABC Sep 28 call                           | > 0.55                 |
+---------------------------------------------+------------------------+
| > ABC Dec 28 call                           | > 0.77                 |
+---------------------------------------------+------------------------+
| > ABC Jan '20 28 call (LEAPS expires Jan    | > 3.50                 |
| > 2020)                                     |                        |

> The premiums for this class increase as the time until expiration is
> extended. Because all of these call options are out-of-the-money (the
> market value is less than the strike price), the entire premium is
> made up of time value. The time value represents the chance that ABC
> will rise to a price that is greater than the strike price of \$28
> before expiration. Note that the 2020 call has much higher time value
> because it does not expire for 18 months.

###### The Options Market

> The exam focuses on listed options contracts, which are those that are
> traded on a registered national securities exchange and are issued and
> guaranteed by a registered clearing agency. The most important
> registered exchange for options trading is the **Chicago Board Options
> Exchange (CBOE)**, though options also trade on other exchanges.

######### [The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)]{.underline} 

> The **Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)** plays a vital role in the
> options market, offering risk management along with clearing and
> settlement services. The OCC issues listed options contracts and acts
> as a counterparty for every contract, becoming the buyer for every
> seller and the seller for every buyer. In this capacity, it ensures
> that the obligations of the contracts it clears are fulfilled and that
> parties to the trade perform their responsibilities and complete
> settlement. Because of this, listed options have no counterparty risk.
>
> To exercise options contracts, options buyers give notice to their
> broker-dealers, which in turn notify the Options Clearing Corporation.
> The OCC acts as the middleman and is respon- sible for the assignment
> process. It sends assignment notices to clearing members with
> outstanding short positions in the same options series through a
> random process, or assigns on a first-in, first-out basis, meaning the
> oldest short is assigned the position.
>
> The OCC **automatically exercises** any expiring equity call or put in
> a customer account that is \$0.01 or more in-the-money, unless the
> customer gives other instructions.

###### Trading of Options Contracts

> In addition to the exercise and expiration of options contracts, the
> third and most frequent outcome is the trading of options contracts in
> the options market.
>
> Options trading involves entering into and exiting options positions
> before they expire. Investors can enter or exit the market with either
> a purchase of a call or put or with the sale of a call or put. Trading
> an options contract is also known as **closing**, **liquidating**, or
> **offsetting** the position.

######### [Opening and Closing Options Transactions]{.underline} 

> An investor enters into the market by **opening an option position**.
> The opening transaction may be either a purchase or sale.

-   **Opening purchase**---An investor opens a position by buying a call
    or put.

-   **Opening sale**---An investor opens a position by selling a call or
    put.

> Getting out of the market, or **closing an option transaction**, is
> always the reverse of the opening transaction. Closing transactions
> can be either purchases or sales.

-   **Closing sale**---An investor that owns an option can exit the
    position with a closing sale of a contract with the same terms.

    height="8.677055993000875e-2in"}**Closing purchase**---An investor
    that wrote an option can exit the position with a closing purchase
    of a contract with the same terms.

> ***Example***
>
> Chuck **wrote 2 ABC Jan 40 calls at 4**. How is this position closed?
>
> Chuck opened his position with an **opening sale**, so to close his
> position and eliminate his obligation to sell shares of ABC at 40, he
> must make a **closing purchase** and buy 2 ABC Jan 40 calls. Notice
> that he must close the position with the same number of contracts. In
> this example, we will assume that he bought back the contract at a
> premium of \$2 per share. Once his account has two equal and
> offsetting positions, the OCC will cancel them. Chuck will not receive
> an exercise assignment on the short call, nor be able to exercise his
> long call.
>
> The difference in premium between the opening and closing transaction
> is the investor's profit or loss.

######### [Settlement Date, Exercise, and Assignment]{.underline} 

> Options that are bought or sold settle on the next business day.
> **Settlement** is the comple- tion of a securities transaction. When
> purchasing an option contract, the buyer must pay the premium on the
> settlement date, at which point the buyer will legally own the
> contract. The holder can then exercise or trade the contract as
> desired.
>
> The writer of an option will receive the premiums on settlement. At
> that point, the writer will be subject to the receipt of an assignment
> notice requiring the purchase or sale of the underlying shares.
>
> **Next-day settlement (T + 1)** applies to both opening and closing
> transactions.
>
> ***Example***
>
> On Monday, Sarah buys 1 JDS 50 put at 3 in an opening purchase. The
> contract will settle, and her \$300 payment will be due on Tuesday,
> the next business day. At that point Sarah has the right to exercise
> should she so choose.
>
> Later on, JDS declines in value, and the put now trades at a premium
> of 5. Sarah decides to liquidate her position with a closing sale. On
> Friday, Sarah contacts her broker and gives the closing sale order.
> The sale of the JDS put will occur on the next business day, Monday,
> and Sarah will receive \$500 for the sale of the contract.
>
> Overall, Sarah profited \$200 on the trade, less any commissions.

1.  ***Settlement and Options Exercise***

> The settlement process for the exercise of an equity option contract
> requires delivery of the shares. This means that the seller of the
> underlying stock---either the put buyer or call seller---must make
> good delivery of 100 shares to the buyer of the underlying
> stock---either the call buyer or put seller.

2.  ***Settlement and Receiving Dividends on the Underlying Stock***

> An investor who owns an option is not entitled to receive a dividend
> by virtue of the option position. To receive a cash dividend, an
> investor must be an owner of record of the stock on or before the
> record date. If a dividend is declared on stock underlying an option
> contract, exercise notice must be given before the ex-date, which is
> one business day before the record date. In other words, the exercise
> notice must be given at least two business days before the record
> date.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Kate holds 3 ABC Nov calls. ABC has declared a dividend payable to all
> holders of record on Tuesday, November 10. When does Kate need to give
> exercise instructions so that she will be an owner of record on Nov 10
> and receive the dividend?
>
> Kate's exercise instructions must be received no later than Friday,
> November 6, so that the stock purchase through the options contract
> can settle on or before the November 10 record date. If she gives her
> exercise instructions any later, she will not take ownership until
> after the record date and will not receive the dividend. The purchase
> of stock under- lying an option contract settles in two business days
> (T + 2 settlement).

> ***[6.7.3.3 Adjusting Options Contracts for Stock
> Dividends]{.underline}***
>
> As discussed in Chapter 1, when a company pays a stock dividend, the
> cost basis of the inves- tor's position is adjusted to reflect the new
> number of shares. In this scenario, any options contracts must also be
> adjusted to reflect the change. Specifically, the number of shares
> each contract represents will increase, and the strike price will
> decrease proportionately. It's important to note that the total value
> of the contract remains unchanged.
>
> ***Example***
>
> An investor owns 1 ABC 60 call, subject to a 6% stock dividend. The
> total value of the contract is \$60 Strike Price Ã 100 Shares per
> Contract, which equals \$6,000. Given that the investor initially owns
> one contract, which represents 100 shares, a 6% stock dividend means
> that they will receive six more shares and thus have a total of 106
> shares as the stock dividend. To calculate the new strike price, take
> the total contract value of \$6,000 divided by the new share count of
> 106 to get an adjusted strike price of \$56.60.

> *Chapter 6:* Options

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-5 .unnumbered}

1.  (**A**) The seller earns the premium and receives the cash when the
    option trade is settled. Settlement occurs one business day after
    the trade date.

2.  (**B**) It is always the option buyer who pays the premium to the
    seller (writer). The premium is the Number of Options Ã 100 Shares
    per Option Ã Trade Price. The strike price and underlying stock
    price are not relevant for answering this type of question.

3.  (**A**) American-style options can be exercised, at the buyer's
    option, at any time before the expiration date. European-style
    options can only be exercised on the contract expiration date.

4.  (**C**) Listed options contracts expire on the third Friday of the
    expiration month.

5.  (**D**) If an investor is bearish on a company, buying puts will
    give him the option to sell the stock at the strike price for stock
    that has declined in value. Another bearish strategy is selling
    calls, but the maximum possible gain from this position is just the
    premium earned.

6.  (**B**) Many investors believe that selling calls without owning the
    underlying stock can be a viable way to generate income (from
    premiums) with very little capital committed.

> The problem is that naked call writing has *unlimited potential for
> loss*, if the stock soars in value.

7.  (**D**) The options will go in-the-money when the stock hits \$95.
    But he is out the \$4.50 premium per share. For a call option buyer,
    the breakeven point is Strike + Premium =

> \$95 + \$4.50 = \$99.50. Above \$99.50, the position profits.

8.  (**B**) The downside risk of a stock short sale is that the stock
    rises sharply in value. This risk can be offset by purchasing call
    options, which give the investor the right to repurchase the stock
    at the strike price if the option is exercised.

9.  (**A**) Ignore premium for purposes of determining whether positions
    are in-the-money or out-of-the-money. Puts are in-the-money when the
    stock price is below the strike price and out-of-the-money when the
    stock price is above the strike price. In this case, they are \$7
    out-of-the-money (\$47 â \$40).

10. (**A**) The purpose of a protective put is to hedge a long stock
    position against a downturn. If the stock and options positions are
    matched, any price losses in the stock will be offset dollar for
    dollar by gains in the bought puts. The cost of having this
    insurance is the premium paid to buy the puts.

11. (**D**) Stock index options have important applications for hedging
    the general stock market risk that is embedded in almost all stocks.
    The combination of long stock plus a purchased stock index put will
    profit to the extent that the stock outperforms the index.

12. (**D**) All factors being equal, options that have the most time
    remaining until expiration will have the greatest time value and
    thus the highest premiums.

> *Chapter 6:* Options

#### Unit Exam---Solutions (Continued) {#unit-examsolutions-continued-5 .unnumbered}

13. (**D**) The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) acts as the legal
    counterparty to all listed options contracts. It is the buyer for
    every contract sold and the seller of every contract bought. This
    adds an element of security for options traders, giving them the
    assurance that contract terms will be fulfilled.

14. (**B**) The closing transaction must be the opposite of the action
    taken at the opening trade in the same contract. If the opening
    trade is to buy puts, the closing trade would be to sell puts. Her
    profit is the difference between premium paid (-\$2.50) and closing
    transaction price (\$4.50): \$2 per share or \$200 per contract.

15. (**B**) Settlement occurs on the business day after the trade date
    (T + 1).

16. (**C**) Option holders are not entitled to dividends paid on the
    underlying common stock. They must exercise and actually own the
    stock before the dividend record date. To receive the dividend, the
    exercise notice must be given before the dividend ex-date, which is
    one business day before the record date (T + 2 settlement).

### Suitability and Investment Risks

> To build a lasting and successful career in the securities industry,
> registered representatives must commit to doing the right thing for
> their customers and guide them in making sound and suitable investment
> decisions. This requires registered reps to have a thorough under-
> standing of the various securities products and their risk profiles
> and how these match up with their customers' objectives and financial
> circumstances. The ultimate goal is to ensure that recommendations are
> appropriate, and in the case of retail investors, in their best
> interest.
>
> This chapter will review the rules surrounding recommendations to
> customers, as well as investment goals and associated risks.

####### Chapter Goals {#chapter-goals-6 .unnumbered}

-   Describe the different types of investment risk and the strategies
    and investments that can be used to mitigate each.

-   Explain each investment objective and the appropriate
    recommendations for each.

-   Compare and contrast the risks and benefits of the various
    securities products.

-   Distinguish between the three main security asset classes and
    understand the purpose of asset allocation and diversification.

-   Know how to calculate both the current yield and total return of an
    equity security.

####### Key Terms {#key-terms-6 .unnumbered}

-   **Preservation of capital objective**---A customer investment
    objective that has the goal of zero decline in the value of that
    person's investment or portfolio

-   **Current income objective**---A customer investment objective that
    has the goal of generating current cash for the investor with little
    focus on growth and long-term appreciation

-   **Tax-free income objective**---A customer investment objective,
    only appropriate for high-income investors, that has the goal of
    generating tax-free income through investments in municipal bonds

-   **Growth objective**---A customer investment objective that has the
    goal of long-term portfolio appreciation, with little focus on
    generating current cash

-   **Liquidity objective**---A customer investment objective that has
    the goal of immediate access to funds in order to meet a short-term
    goal

> *Chapter 7* Suitability and Investment Risks

-   **Speculation objective**---A customer investment objective that has
    the goal of seeking outsized investment returns in exchange for
    taking on much higher risk

-   **Asset allocation**---The process of mixing a customer's
    investments across the three major investment asset
    classes---stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents---in order to
    reduce the portfolio's risk

-   **Diversification**---A risk management strategy where an investor
    mixes a wide variety of investments in different sectors within a
    portfolio so that the positive performance of some investments
    neutralize the negative performance of others

###### Suitability and Regulation Best Interest (BI) Requirements

> In order to ensure investor protection, securities regulators have
> strict rules in place when it comes to securities professionals
> soliciting or recommending investments to their clients. FINRA Rule
> 2111, which applies to institutional customers, requires that
> suggested invest- ments be suitable for the client based on its needs,
> objectives, time horizon, risk tolerance, tax bracket, and more. The
> analysis of whether a recommendation is suitable is composed of three
> main obligations: reasonable basis, customer-specific, and
> quantitative suitability, which are detailed below.
>
> Also, discussed in this section is Securities and Exchange Commission
> (SEC) Regulation Best Interest (BI), which applies to retail
> investors. Regulation BI goes a step further than FINRA's suitability
> standard, requiring that broker-dealers only make recommendations to
> retail clients that are in their customers' best interests.

######### Reasonable Basis Suitability

> A broker must have a **reasonable basis** to believe, based on an
> analysis of the potential risks and rewards of a possible
> recommendation, that the security or strategy is suitable for at least
> *some* investors. This reasonable basis suitability does not need to
> consider each customer on their own; instead it focuses on the rep's
> understanding of the product.
>
> What kind of products or investments might fail the reasonable-basis
> test? For example, an investment that is all risk but no return.
> Likewise, a fraud, scheme, or manipulative device would fail this
> test. And, finally, if a rep does not fully understand a product and
> its features, but nonetheless recommends it, the test fails.

######### Customer-Specific Suitability

> **Customer-specific suitability** requires that a rep, based on a
> particular customer's specific investment profile, have a reasonable
> basis to believe a recommendation is suitable for that institutional
> customer. The broker must attempt to obtain and analyze a broad array
> of customer-specific factors to support this determination, including
> the financial situation of the client.
>
> Put together, reasonable basis suitability requires the rep to
> understand the product and that it be suitable for someone, and
> customer-specific suitability requires that the product be suitable
> for the specific institutional client.
>
> ***[7.1.2.1 Institutional Account Exemption from Customer-Specific
> Suitability]{.underline}***
>
> Institutional investors may be exempt from customer-specific
> suitability requirements if two criteria are met. First, the rep must
> believe the institutional client is capable of evaluating investment
> risks independently. Second, the institutional investor must
> affirmatively indi- cate it is exercising independent judgment in
> evaluating the recommendations.
>
> Under the suitability rule, institutional investors include banks,
> insurance companies, investment companies, and any other person
> (including retail clients) with total assets of at least \$50 million.
> For example, an ultra-high-net-worth individual (e.g., Bill Gates or
> Warren Buffet) is considered institutional under FINRA Rule 2111.

######### Quantitative Suitability

> **Quantitative suitability** considers the account's turnover rate and
> the use of in-and-out trading, among other things, to determine
> whether the institutional client is being abused, not based on the
> specific products in the account, but due to the timing, frequency,
> and quantity of transactions.
>
> ***Example***
>
> An institutional client who has a long-term time horizon and a high
> risk tolerance may be properly placed in a diversified equity
> portfolio, but if the rep regularly trades in and out of similar
> large-cap equity positions, this may be a quantitative suitability
> violation. In this scenario, each individual position conforms to the
> objectives, but overall, there is too much trading in the account.
>
> For *each* recommendation, a rep must consider and adhere to all three
> of the suitability tests.

######### Regulation Best Interest (BI)

> In 2019, the SEC passed **Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)** to
> enhance standards of retail investor protection. It establishes a
> heightened standard of conduct for broker-dealers and registered
> representatives when making recommendations of securities
> transactions, investment strategies, or types of accounts to retail
> customers. In meeting this standard, the interests of the customers
> must be placed ahead of the interests of the firm and its
> representatives.
>
> Reg BI raises the bar from FINRA's suitability standard, described
> above, which previously applied to all customer recommendations. It
> requires that broker-dealers do **the right thing**, not just make
> recommendations that are within the zone of what is appropriate for
> the customer.
>
> Under Reg BI, a recommendation is any communication that could be
> viewed as a call to action and would influence an investor's behavior.
> Recommendations covered by Reg BI include those addressing:

-   Specific securities (to buy, sell, hold XYZ or XYZ fund)

-   Specific account types (to open an IRA or another brokerage account)

-   Rollovers or transfers (to move a workplace retirement plan or
    change IRA trustees)

> To comply with Reg BI, firms must address the four obligations below:
>
> *Chapter 7* Suitability and Investment Risks
>
> *Chapter 7* Suitability and Investment Risks

1.  **Disclosure Obligation**---Provide certain required disclosure
    about the recommendation, such as fees and costs, and the
    relationship with the retail customer through a **Customer
    Relationship Summary (Form CRS)**, which must be provided to the
    customer at or prior to the time of the recommendation

2.  **Care Obligation**---Exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill
    in making the recommendation

3.  **Conflict of Interest Obligation**---Establish, maintain, and
    enforce written policies and procedures to address conflicts of
    interest, and

4.  **Compliance Obligation**---Establish, maintain, and enforce written
    policies and procedures to achieve compliance with Reg BI

> Reg BI requires broker-dealers to disclose all material facts relating
> to conflicts of interest when making a recommendation, including
> conflicts of interest associated with proprietary products, payments
> from third parties, and compensation programs.

######### The Know-Your-Customer Rule

> Working in tandem with the rules discussed above, FINRA Rule 2090
> requires firms to know the essential facts concerning every customer
> in order to effectively service the custom- er's account and make
> appropriate investment recommendations. The goal is to ensure that
> investment strategies reflect each customer's unique investment
> objectives and risk tolerance.
>
> This obligation begins at the start of the customer relationship and
> usually requires the completion of an investor profile. This profile
> is typically part of the **new account form**. It includes questions
> about the investor and requests the following:

-   Personal information, including employment status, relationship
    status, and number of dependents

-   Financial situation, including annual income, net worth, and tax
    status

-   Liquidity considerations

-   Investment risk tolerance and experience, and

-   Investment objectives and time horizon

######### MSRB and Recommendations

> The MSRB's rule dealing with recommendations are similar to the SEC's
> and FINRA's, dis- cussed above. To provide even greater protection in
> the municipal securities market, MSRB Rule G-47 also requires firms
> and registered reps to provide **time of trade disclosures**. The
> rule, which applies to both primary and secondary market transactions,
> requires firms to disclose to customers, at or prior to the
> transaction, all material information known about the security that is
> reasonably accessible to the market. This applies to both solicited
> and unsolicited transactions.

###### Types of Risks

> In addition to knowing and understanding each customer's specific
> situation, it is also essential for registered reps to understand the
> various securities products that have been discussed, as well as the
> different risks associated with each.
>
> These risks have been previously discussed throughout the first few
> chapters, but this sec- tion provides a nice summary of them in one
> place, including the most susceptible invest- ments as well as
> strategies to reduce each risk.

######### [Call Risk]{.underline} 

> **Call risk** is the risk that an investment, often a bond or
> preferred stock, may be called by an issuer when interest rates are
> falling. Securities issued with a call feature allow the issuer to buy
> them back in order to re-issue new securities, often with a lower
> interest or dividend payment. Because securities are called in falling
> interest rate environments, investors typi- cally lose a relatively
> high rate of return.
>
> Some investments offer **call protection**, which means that the
> instrument cannot be called away for a certain period of time. This
> feature helps protect investors, as their bonds cannot be redeemed by
> the issuer during this period.
>
> *Chapter 7* Suitability and Investment Risks

######### [Reinvestment Rate Risk]{.underline} 

> Call risk leads to **reinvestment risk**, which is the risk that no
> available investments will be able to provide a return similar to that
> of the security that has been called. For example, an investor who
> holds an 8% bond receives \$80 in annual interest each year. If
> interest rates have fallen over time, the \$80 that is earned each
> year cannot be reinvested at the same 8% rate, as issuers are able to
> borrow more cheaply in the marketplace. If the investor reinvests the
> \$80 in instruments with similar characteristics, the investor might
> only receive a 5% rate of return.

######### [Capital Risk]{.underline} 

> The risk that an investor could lose his entire investment is referred
> to as **capital risk**.
>
> For example, an investor who buys options contracts bears significant
> capital risk, because if the option expires out-of-the-money, the
> entire investment, all premiums paid, will be lost.
>
> *Chapter 7* Suitability and Investment Risks
>
> Capital risk is often associated with more exotic investments and less
> with investments in stocks or bonds, as they can, but are less likely,
> to go all the way to zero.

######### Credit Risk

> **Credit risk** describes the possibility that an issuer will default,
> i.e., miss an interest pay- ment or be unable to return borrowed
> principal (par value) at maturity. To attract investors, issuers that
> are less creditworthy (i.e., those with higher credit or default risk)
> have to issue bonds with higher interest rates than issuers that are
> more creditworthy.

######### Inflationary Risk

> Returns can be adversely impacted by inflation. Products that deliver
> a fixed rate of return, such as bonds or preferred stock, are
> susceptible to **inflationary risk** because their interest payments
> (or preferred dividends) remain constant while the cost of goods and
> services rises. For this reason, inflationary risk is also referred to
> as **purchasing power risk**.
>
> Consider an investor who owns a 10% bond with a 10-year maturity. The
> bond will produce interest income of \$100 each year, but in
> inflationary environments, that \$100 buys fewer real goods and

######### [Interest Rate Risk]{.underline} 

> **Interest rate risk** is the risk that an investment's value (its
> price) will change as a result of a change in interest rates. This
> risk affects the value of bonds, preferred stock, and other fixed
> products more directly than common stock. When interest rates rise,
> fixed-income instruments' prices fall; conversely, when interest rates
> fall, their prices rise---an inverse relationship exists between
> prices and rates.
>
> Inflation risk and interest rate risk are related and often
> experienced together, as interest rates often go up with inflation.
> This is a real problem for fixed-income investors, for exam- ple,
> retirees who live on their portfolio income generated from bonds.
> During periods of high inflation, the retiree's coupon payments are
> stable, but the real purchasing power of
>
> those dollars is reduced, and, if in an effort to curb the inflation,
> the central bank raises interest rates, the market value of all of the
> retiree's bonds will fall (remember the inverse relationship).

######### [Prepayment Risk]{.underline} 

> One interest-rate-related risk associated with mortgage-backed
> securities (MBS) is **prepay- ment risk**. When mortgage holders
> refinance to a lower rate, MBS holders experience an early return of
> their principal. Typically, mortgagees will refinance in
> falling-interest-rate environments, leaving the MBS holder to reinvest
> the capital in the lower-interest-rate envi- ronment. This could also
> be described as a type of **reinvestment rate risk**.

######### [Liquidity Risk]{.underline} 

> An investment that cannot be readily sold or converted to cash in the
> open market is described as having **liquidity risk** or
> **marketability risk**. Examples of illiquid investments include
> shares in direct participation programs, unlisted and non-traded
> investments, and real estate. Assets that are widely traded, like
> treasuries, blue chip stocks, and redeemable mutual funds, have very
> little liquidity risk.

######### [Political Risk]{.underline} 

> New legislation or changes in political control can significantly
> influence market perfor- mance. **Political risk** is encountered in
> both highly industrialized nations and developing countries. In
> unstable countries, the chance of government overthrow, war, and
> insurrection are typical political risks; in developed countries,
> terrorism, legislation changes, and elec- tions are more likely to be
> political risks.

*Chapter 7* Suitability and Investment Risks

######### [Currency Risk]{.underline} 

> **Currency risk** is the risk that an investment denominated in a
> foreign currency (e.g., the Japanese yen or the Euro) will lose value
> or depreciate as the US dollar strengthens. For example, if an
> investor owns an ADR denominated in yen, even if that company had been
> performing well, if the Japanese currency is devalued, the value of
> the ADR will be negatively affected, as an investor will receive fewer
> US dollars when they sell or receive dividends from the foreign
> security.

######### Systematic Risk

> **Market risk** or **systematic risk** reflects that the performance
> of an individual security will be impacted by the performance of the
> overall market. Some common sources of systematic risk are recessions,
> wars, significant political events, and interest rates. Though
> systematic risk cannot be avoided through diversification, it can be
> hedged with investments in deriv- atives, such as options contracts,
> as discussed earlier.

######### Non-Systematic Risk

> Unlike systematic risk, which influences a large number of assets,
> **non-systematic risk**, also referred to as **business risk**,
> generally will not impact an investor's entire portfolio. Changes in
> corporate management or product recalls, which could impact a single
> stock, are exam- ples of this type of risk. Corporate scandal, poor
> management, and changing technologies also represent business risk.
> Well-known examples include Volkswagen's emissions scandal,
> BlackBerry's inability to keep up with the smartphone revolution, and
> Blockbuster Video failing to adapt to streaming video.
>
> The best protection against non-systematic risk is portfolio
> diversification. The rationale behind diversification is that no
> single investment will affect the overall return of the port- folio
> because each individual position makes up only a small portion of the
> overall portfolio.

#### Progress Check---Solutions {#progress-checksolutions-6 .unnumbered}

1.  (**A**) Speculation is the objective with the highest level of risk
    and return potential. Generally, this objective signals that an
    investment is suitable only for sophisticated or experienced
    investors with substantial capital and ability to withstand losses.

2.  (**C**) The analysis of whether a recommendation is suitable for an
    institutional client has three main obligations: reasonable-basis,
    customer-specific, and quantitative suitability. It's important to
    know the requirements of each.

3.  (**D**) The numerical standard of reasonable-basis suitability is
    deliberately vague---an investment must be suitable for at least
    some investors. The rationale is that the firm and its registered
    reps must ensure that the investment is not a fraud, is not using
    misleading data or information, and at least has the *potential* to
    achieve its stated objectives.

4.  (**B**) Regulation Best Interest (BI) applies to recommendations
    made to retail investors. Recommendations made to institutional
    investors are subject to FINRA's suitability standard.

5.  (**C**) The risk that an investment will decline all the way to
    zero, wiping out the investor's capital, is called capital risk. It
    is most prevalent in buying listed options, where all premium can be
    lost if an option expires out-of-the-money, and in exotic or
    unconventional investments such as direct participation programs.

6.  (**C**) Long-term US Treasury bonds are considered some of the
    safest investments in terms of credit quality, but they are high in
    one type of risk: inflationary. This is the risk that purchasing
    power will decline significantly over time due to high inflation.
    Long-term, fixed-income investments are most vulnerable. Stocks and
    real estate are thought to have better potential to offset high
    inflation.

7.  (**B**) Prepayment risk is the risk that mortgages in MBS pools will
    prepay principal at a faster pace than anticipated, returning
    capital to investors that they cannot reinvest at the same yield. It
    is a type of risk distinctly linked to one product: MBS. Don't
    confuse it with call risk and reinvestment rate risk, both of which
    are found in callable bonds.

8.  (**A**) Currency risk is the risk that investments denominated in
    foreign currencies will depreciate as the US dollar strengthens. An
    investment in a foreign stock, for example, may have low currency
    risk in a weak-dollar era but high currency risk in a strong-dollar
    era. This demonstrates why suitability analysis may need to consider
    not just the merits of an investment but also the macro economic and
    monetary policy climates.

######  Investment Objectives and Suitable Recommendations

> Once a registered rep has evaluated the customer's specific financial
> and non-financial con- siderations and the risks of various securities
> products, she is then tasked with recommend- ing a suitable investment
> for that investor based on the customer's objectives.
>
> Generally, the more years that remain to reach the financial goal, the
> more investment risk that can be afforded. Therefore, much of the
> principal invested to meet long-term goals is often allocated to
> growth investments, such as individual stocks, stock mutual funds, and
> ETFs. As retirement or a short-term goal approaches (e.g., purchasing
> a home), it is import- ant to shift assets into less risky,
> income-producing assets, such as bonds.
>
> This section will discuss the various investment objectives---i.e.,
> the needs customers may be trying to fulfill with their
> portfolios---as well as what investments are appropriate for meeting
> those needs.

######### [Safety and Preservation of Capital]{.underline} 

> An investor who has a **preservation of capital objective** seeks no
> decline in the value of her investments. The investor does not want to
> lose any money. Instead, emphasis is placed on protection of the
> invested principal and loss prevention and in return the investor is
> willing to accept a lower rate of return. This strategy is generally
> most appropriate for retirees and those approaching retirement, to
> help protect their nest eggs, as they may not have time to recoup
> their losses if a downturn in the market occurs. In addition,
> oftentimes a goal of safety is combined with that of generating
> current income to help those in retirement have enough funds to pay
> their ongoing expenses.
>
> These investments pay low rates of interest and may not even outpace
> the rate of inflation. However, since the money will be used
> relatively soon, inflation will not have as large an impact on the
> purchasing power of these funds.

######### Current Income

> For an investor with a **current income objective**, emphasis is
> placed on generating cash for the investor, with little focus on
> long-term capital appreciation. As mentioned above, this strategy
> might be used in conjunction with preservation of capital, especially
> by those at or near retirement age, or by investors willing to take on
> additional risk (e.g., high-yield bonds) for a greater income amount.

######### Tax-Free Income

> A tax-free income objective emphasizes generating tax-free income for
> persons in high tax brackets.
>
> *Chapter 7* Suitability and Investment Risks

######### [Growth]{.underline} 

> An investor with a **growth objective** is seeking capital
> appreciation as well as to increase the value of his portfolio over
> time. A pure growth investor has little focus on generating current
> income. Because of the uncertainty of the market, growth investors
> must be individuals who are willing to take on more risk and often
> include younger investors, who can better weather the stock market's
> ups and downs.

######### [Liquidity]{.underline} 

> For an investor that has a **liquidity objective**, emphasis is placed
> on the investor having immediate access to their funds at all times.
> One example of when this strategy might be prudent is an investor who
> will need to access her funds within the next year to purchase a home.

######### [Speculation]{.underline} 

> An investor that has a speculation objective seeks outsized returns in
> exchange for taking on greater risk. This type of strategy is often
> appropriate for a high-net-worth investor, or an institution, who is
> able to afford to lose a portion of overall net worth.

###### Portfolio Strategies and Analysis

> Once all the necessary information is gathered, the next
> responsibility of the registered representative is to help customers
> build a portfolio designed to meet their investment objectives and
> needs. This section will discuss some of the strategies that
> registered repre- sentatives might implement to help create an
> optimized client portfolio.

######### [Asset Allocation]{.underline} 

> **Asset allocation** involves choosing an appropriate mix of different
> **asset classes** to build a portfolio. The process of determining the
> right selection of assets to hold is specific to each customer and
> depends largely on the customer's time horizon, investment objectives,
> and risk tolerance. The objective of an asset allocation strategy is
> to ensure that the overall portfolio includes asset categories that
> react differently under different market conditions. By investing in
> more than one asset class, overall risk is reduced, and the investment
> returns will have a smoother ride.
>
> The three major investment asset classes are stocks, bonds, and cash
> and cash equivalents.

-   **Stocks** historically offer the highest potential reward but have
    the greatest risk among the three major asset categories. Their
    volatility makes them a risky investment in the short term, but
    investors that have been willing to ride out their volatile returns
    have generally been rewarded in the long run.

-   **Bonds** are usually less volatile than stocks but offer more
    modest returns. As a result, an investor approaching a financial
    goal might increase bond holdings relative to stock holdings to
    reduce risk.

-   **Cash and cash equivalents** are the safest investments, but offer
    the lowest returns. Examples include savings deposits, certificates
    of deposits (CDs), US Treasury bills, and money market funds, which
    offer little if any risk of loss to the holder. The key risk with
    these assets is that inflation will outpace and erode returns over
    time.

> Once a specific target allocation mix is established, the portfolio is
> periodically rebalanced to return it to its original proportionate
> investment mix, to ensure that no single asset or asset category is
> overemphasized. This is referred to as **portfolio rebalancing**.
>
> For example, assume that stock investments were intended to represent
> 60% of a portfolio. After a recent stock market rally, the stock
> investments represent 80% of the portfolio. To rebalance and
> reestablish the original asset allocation mix, some of the stock could
> be sold or additional assets from the underweighted category could be
> purchased.
>
> *Chapter 7* Suitability and Investment Risks

######### [Diversification]{.underline} 

> The old phrase "Don't put all of your eggs in one basket" sums up the
> concept of **diversifi- cation**. The practice of spreading money
> among different investments is typically effective for minimizing
> portfolio losses. Ideally, with proper diversification, the loss
> experienced by one investment is offset by gains in another.
>
> While asset allocation diversifies assets among asset categories, some
> investors may delib- erately choose to concentrate their investments
> within a particular asset class. For example,
>
> *Chapter 7* Suitability and Investment Risks
>
> a 25-year-old investor may choose a portfolio that includes only
> stocks because of the long- term investment horizon. Diversification
> is still important with this strategy, but in this case, it applies
> within the asset category, instead of between asset classes.
>
> Mutual funds are often viewed as an easy way for investors to achieve
> diversification for a small amount of money. For example, a stock
> index fund may hold stock in thousands of companies. Because each
> outstanding share represents a proportionate interest in a broad
> portfolio, significant diversification has been achieved.

###### Investment Returns

> Monitoring returns is an important part of the investment process. As
> time progresses, investors and their registered reps must evaluate
> investments to ensure they are achieving the intended goals. If
> investments are not showing positive returns, especially in comparison
> to market benchmarks for similar securities, it may be time to change
> portfolio allocation or diversify into different economic sectors. To
> free up money to make new purchases, it may be appropriate to sell
> investments that underperformed and review overall asset allocation to
> ensure it aligns with the investor profile and risk tolerance.
>
> This section will review total return, which is an important metric
> for investors.

######### [Total Return]{.underline} 

> **Total return** encompasses all of the money that is made on an
> investment, including income from dividends and interest, price
> changes while the investment is held, and, ultimately, capital gains
> or losses when the investment is sold. Total return is typically
> evaluated over a defined time period, such as a year or a quarter, and
> can be positive or negative.
>
> Total return can be calculated for various investments, though for
> this exam, the calcula- tions for equity and bondholders are relevant.
>
> ***[7.6.1.1 Total Return on Equity]{.underline}***
>
> The total return on a stock investment includes dividends received
> plus any increase or decrease in the price of the stock over the
> period. The calculation can be performed using realized or unrealized
> gains and losses, depending on whether the stock has been sold.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > **Dividends + Capital Gains\***                                     |
+=======================================================================+
| > **Total Return on Equity =**                                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > **Initial Purchase Price**                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> \* If the position is sold at a loss, the capital loss should be
> subtracted.
>
> ***[7.6.1.2 Current Yield of Common Stock]{.underline}***
>
> Another way to evaluate the return on common stock is by calculating
> its current yield, which is the annual dividend divided by the current
> market price. Make sure that if a quar- terly dividend is provided
> that you annualize it by multiplying by four.
>
> ***Example***
>
> XYZ stock is trading at \$15 and pays a quarterly dividend of \$0.30.
> Current Yield = (\$0.30 Ã 4)/\$15 = 8%
>
> *Chapter 7* Suitability and Investment Risks
>
> ***[7.6.1.3 Total Return on Bonds]{.underline}***
>
> For bonds, total return includes the interest earned during the time
> period and the principal repaid at maturity, if the bond is held to
> maturity. If the bond is sold before maturity, the difference between
> the price paid at purchase and the price received at the sale is added
> (or subtracted, if sold at a loss) to the interest income.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> \* If the bond is held to maturity and returns the par value, there is
> not a capital gain or loss. Instead, the difference between the
> purchase price and par value is used.

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-6 .unnumbered}

1.  (**B**) Preservation of capital, or capital preservation, is an
    objective that has the goal of no decline in the value of an
    investment or portfolio. Most money market mutual funds have this
    objective because they endeavor to maintain a net asset value of \$1
    at all times.

2.  (**D**) Regulation BI requires that a customer relationship summary
    (Form CRS) be provided to a retail customer at the time of or prior
    to any recommendations being made.

3.  (**D**) Reasonable-basis suitability determines that an investment
    is suitable for at least some investors. If the investment fails to
    meet this standard, it cannot be recommended to anyone by that firm.

4.  (**B**) An investor purchasing Treasury securities would be most
    concerned with interest rate risk, as if interest rates increase,
    the price of their bonds would decrease. Because Treasuries are
    backed by the U.S. Government, the investor would not be concerned
    with credit risk, also known as default risk. Also, for exam
    purposes, assume that the

> U.S. Government has little political risk as compared to foreign
> countries.

5.  (**A**) Credit risk measures the potential for an issuer to default
    on bond interest or on paying bond principal due at maturity.

6.  (**B**) An investment that cannot be readily sold or converted to
    cash in the open market has liquidity risk. Examples include real
    estate, limited partnerships, and hedge funds with lock-ups. The
    illiquid character of these investments cannot be changed, and it
    also usually cannot be hedged. The risk is that an investor will
    need access to cash but

> will not be able to obtain it. To address this, the client can
> increase liquidity in the rest of his portfolio, so cash can be
> obtained from other sources.

7.  (**B**) Systematic risk reflects the performance of an individual
    security that is impacted by the direction of the overall market.
    For owners of stocks, it is highest in a bear ( falling) stock
    market. Since systematic risk is symmetrical, it also exists in a
    bull market. But it generally helps stock investors in this case, by
    putting the tailwind of the market behind their stocks' performance.

8.  (**A**) An investor with a preservation of capital objective seeks
    no decline in the value of the investment or portfolio. Stocks are
    not compatible because they can decline in value. Short-term
    Treasuries, bank CDs, and money market funds have very stable
    principal values.

9.  (**C**) Stocks only generate current income from their dividends,
    which are somewhat predictable, not their appreciation, which is not
    predictable. However, stock dividends are not guaranteed, so it's
    important to evaluate not only the rate of dividends paid but also
    the consistency of historic dividend payments.

10. (**C**) Preferred stock does not have much growth potential and is
    not stable enough in price to preserve capital. Preferred dividends
    can be attractive to investors with a current

> *Chapter 7:* Suitability and Investment Risks

#### Unit Exam---Solutions (Continued) {#unit-examsolutions-continued-6 .unnumbered}

> income objective. Since preferred dividends are taxable, investors
> seeking tax-free income should look elsewhere.

11. (**B**) The objectives of capital appreciation and safety are
    somewhat incompatible. However, long-term, zero-coupon US Treasuries
    can meet both objectives. Since interest is not currently paid but
    builds up inside the bond and is paid at maturity, it is actually a
    form of capital appreciation (the bond will be worth far more at
    maturity). The lack of reinvestment risk helps meet the need for
    predictability and safety.

12. (**D**) Mutual funds can be used to pursue diverse investment
    objectives, depending on how funds are managed and what securities
    they hold. The type of mutual fund that is compatible with an
    objective of tax-free income is a municipal bond fund.

13. (**B**) Asset allocation programs choose an appropriate mix of
    different asset classes to build a portfolio. These classes
    typically include stocks, bonds, and cash. The objective is to
    ensure the overall portfolio includes asset classes that react
    differently under changing market conditions---i.e., that the
    portfolio is well diversified. Often, the

> program will make periodic adjustments to keep the asset class mix
> appropriate for the current environment, as well as the investor's
> life phase and objectives.

14. (**B**) When asset allocation programs are rebalanced, the goal is
    to return asset classes to their original weights, to ensure that no
    class is over-emphasized. This means that recent winners will be
    sold and recent losers will be bought. Rebalancing can be done
    automatically and mechanically or it can use a professional
    manager's discretion.

> In either case, the goal is to compensate for market actions and keep
> the asset allocation guidelines intact.

15. (**B**) The formula for calculating total return over a holding
    period is to add the dividends and capital gains and divide the
    result by the initial purchase price.

> +\$1 â \$5 = â\$4.
>
> â\$4/\$40 = â10%.

16. (**D**) Current yield of a stock is calculated as annual dividend
    divided by the current market price. Make sure that if a quarterly
    dividend is provided, as is the case in this question, it is
    annualized by multiplying by 4. Therefore, current yield = (\$0.60 x
    4)/\$30 = 8%.

### Issuing Securities

> When corporations or governments are in need of additional capital,
> they can sell equity or debt securities to both institutional and
> retail investors. New issues are sold in the **primary market**, and a
> broker-dealer's investment banking department is often engaged to
> assist the issuer in determining how best to structure the offering
> and distribute the securities. A group of firms working together in
> this process is called a **syndicate**, and the firms that share
> financial risk in the offering are **underwriters**.
>
> This chapter will discuss the process of selling new issues of
> securities to investors, including registering the securities with the
> SEC, exemptions from SEC registration, and the role of investment
> banks in this process.

####### Chapter Goals {#chapter-goals-7 .unnumbered}

-   Know the role of the SEC in the new-issue process.

-   Describe the SEC-registration process, and know the timeline of
    events.

-   Understand the exemptions from SEC registration.

-   Compare and contrast each firm's role within the syndicate.

-   Distinguish between a firm commitment and a best efforts
    underwriting.

-   Be able to calculate the underwriting spread.

-   Learn who is restricted from purchasing an initial public offering
    of common stock.

-   Describe some of the unique aspects of municipal bond underwriting.

####### Key Terms {#key-terms-7 .unnumbered}

-   **Securities Act of 1933**---A federal law designed to prohibit
    fraud and ensure that investors receive all material information
    relating to new issues by requiring new securities to be
    SEC-registered, unless the security is exempt or sold in an exempt
    transaction

-   **Registration statement**---A legal document companies file with
    the SEC to register their securities for legal sale to the public

-   **Exempt securities**---Securities, including US government and
    agency securities, municipal bonds, nonprofit securities, commercial
    bank securities, and short-term corporate debt, that are exempt from
    SEC-registration requirements

> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities

-   **Exempt transactions**---Transactions, including private
    placements, and intrastate offerings, that are exempt from
    SEC-registration requirements due to the manner of sale

-   **Private placement**---An exempt transaction that allows a company
    to raise new capital privately, without public sale, and avoid SEC
    registration

-   **Syndicate**---A group of investment banks that work together to
    help an issuer market and sell securities to the public by sharing
    in the risk of the offering

-   **Firm commitment**---The most common type of underwriting, in which
    the syndicate buys the shares from the issuer and resells them to
    the public, taking on financial liability for whatever cannot be
    resold

-   **Best efforts**---A type of underwriting in which the underwriters
    act as agents and have no financial responsibility for any unsold
    securities

-   **Underwriting spread**---The compensation that the syndicate
    receives in an underwriting, calculated as the difference between
    what the underwriters pay the issuer compared to the public offering
    price that investors pay for the shares

-   **Restricted person**---A type of individual or entity, including
    FINRA member firms, their employees, attorneys and accountants of
    the lead underwriter, and immediate family members of these
    individuals, that is prohibited from purchasing an IPO of common
    stock

###### SEC-Registration Process

> The **Securities Act of 1933**, also called the **Truth in Securities
> Act**, requires all securities to be registered with the Securities
> and Exchange Commission (SEC) unless the security is exempt or sold in
> an exempt transaction. The **'33 Act** was enacted to achieve two
> basic objectives:

-   To require that investors receive significant and material
    information concerning securities being offered for public sale, and

-   To prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale
    of securities to the public

> The '33 Act was the first major federal legislation to regulate the
> offer and sale of securities and to require the provision of
> sufficient information for investors. Disclosure of material
> information is accomplished through the registration of securities
> with the SEC. As part of this process, issuers must compile an
> investor disclosure document, known as the **pro- spectus**, and
> provide it to potential purchasers at or prior to the sale of
> securities. The SEC does not approve an issue for sale or verify the
> information that has been submitted through the registration process;
> its purpose is to ensure that sufficient information is available for
> investors to make informed decisions.

######### [The Registration Statement]{.underline} 

> In order to register securities, issuers must file with the SEC a
> **registration statement**, which contains all material information
> about the company as well as the securities being issued. The
> registration statement details:

-   The name, address, and location of the company and a description of
    business

-   A list of **insiders**, which include officers (e.g., CEO and CFO),
    board members, and greater than 10% stockholders

-   The names of the underwriters and legal counsel involved

-   The amount and planned use of the proceeds being generated through
    the offering

-   Any legal proceedings against the issuer, and

-   Recent certified financial statements of the issuer

> It's important to note that during the period before the registration
> statement is filed, also known as the **pre-filing period** or **quiet
> period**, there typically can be no marketing of the securities and no
> offers or sales to the public.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities

######### [Cooling-Off Period]{.underline} 

> The time from the filing of the registration statement until the SEC
> declares the registration effective is considered a **cooling-off
> period**. During this period, which typically lasts for at least 20
> days, two events are simultaneously taking place: the SEC is reviewing
> the filings for adequate disclosures as required under securities law,
> and separately, the investment bankers are determining market interest
> and a potential price for the new shares.
>
> To promote the new issue, a **road show** typically occurs. During a
> road show the issuer and lead underwriter meet with prospective
> investors to present the offering. Road shows are designed to provide
> potential investors with additional information about the issuer and
> business and give them a more personal opportunity to evaluate the
> offering.
>
> During this time, the underwriter will distribute a **preliminary
> prospectus**, also referred to as a "**red herring**," to potential
> investors. The preliminary prospectus contains informa- tion similar
> to that of the registration statement, which investors can use to
> evaluate the securities. Typically, the preliminary prospectus will
> contain a range of potential prices for the issue, but will not
> contain the final price. The document is nicknamed the "red herring,"
> as the cover contains red ink that states that the preliminary
> prospectus is not actually an offer to investors and that sales can
> only be made with the final prospectus.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> For context, a picture of SNAP's red herring for its 2017 IPO appears
> below. Notice the red cautionary language and the missing share count
> and offer price. During the cooling-off period, the underwriter will
> gauge the demand to determine the exact size and pricing of the
> offering.
>
> ![](media/image13.png)
>
> The goal of these marketing tools is to collect **indications of
> interest (IOIs)**---non-binding indications that an investor might be
> interested in purchasing the shares. These IOIs help the underwriters
> ascertain demand and ultimately the public offering price for the
> issuance. For example, a high number of IOIs will lead the underwriter
> to set a higher price for the securities, as it indicates greater
> demand, whereas fewer IOIs might force the underwriters to set the
> price lower in order to generate additional interest. Although they
> are not promises to buy, IOIs typically become orders on the effective
> date unless cancelled by the investor.
>
> Other communications permitted during the cooling-off period include:

-   **Tombstone ad---**A basic deal announcement that might be published
    > by the underwriter in a newspaper or financial magazine. This
    > advertisement contains factual information about the offering,
    > including the name of the issuer, a brief description of the
    > business, the names of underwriters, and the type of securities.

-   **Free writing prospectus (FWP)**---Allows issuers to provide
    > additional information to investors beyond what is in the
    > registration statement or prospectus. Thus, issuers can provide
    > new and ongoing information during the registration process
    > without having to redo their registration statement or preliminary
    > prospectus. This communication can be written or graphic. Examples
    > of an FWP include a press interview with the issuer's CEO and a
    > recorded, online road show.

> It's important to note that during the cooling-off period, because the
> SEC has not yet granted effectiveness, there can be no offers or sales
> of securities made to the public.

######### [Effective Date]{.underline} 

> Once the bankers have gauged investors' interest in the new shares and
> determined the best price, the issuer will seek effectiveness from the

###### Exemptions from SEC Registration

> As mentioned previously, all securities must be registered with the
> SEC unless they are exempt or sold in an **exempt transaction**. This
> section will focus on exempt securities and transactions, which are
> legal ways to offer and sell securities without registering with the
> SEC. It's important to note that all securities and securities
> transactions, even exempt ones, are subject to anti-fraud provisions
> and that issuers remain responsible for false or misleading
> statements.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> This section will discuss the exempt securities and various exempt
> transactions, including those under Rule 147, Regulation D, Rule 144,
> Rule 144A, and Rule 145.

######### [Exempt Securities]{.underline} 

> Certain securities are exempt from the registration process discussed
> above, regardless of how they are sold. These securities are not
> required to file a registration statement with the SEC or distribute a
> prospectus to potential investors. **Exempt securities** include:

-   US government securities and US government agency securities

-   Securities issued by nonprofits

-   Municipal bonds

-   Commercial paper and other short-term corporate debt with a maximum
    maturity of no more than 270 days

-   Commercial bank securities

> Note that the exemption for securities sold by banks applies
> specifically to those sold by commercial banks. Securities of
> investment banks and of bank holding companies are not exempt from
> registration.

######### [Rule 147---Intrastate Offerings]{.underline} 

> The Securities Act of 1933 includes an exemption that facilitates the
> financing of local busi- ness operations. **Rule 147** allows a
> company to sell securities within its home state and avoid SEC
> registration. In order to use this intrastate offering exemption, the
> company must have its principal place of business in the state and
> satisfy at least *one* of the following requirements:

-   At least 80% of the gross revenues come from doing business within
    the state

-   At least 80% of its assets are located in that state

-   At least 80% of the net proceeds from the offering are used in the
    state, or

-   A majority of the employees are located in the state Additionally,
    100% of the securities must be sold to state residents.

> Purchasers of Rule 147 securities are required to hold the securities
> for a minimum of six months before selling them to someone who resides
> outside the state. Resales to residents of the state are not subject
> to a holding period.
>
> ***Example***
>
> ABC Co. is a New York-based company, which has a majority of its
> employees located in New York City. Under Rule 147, ABC can sell
> securities to New York state residents without SEC registration.
> Investors cannot resell the shares outside of New York for six months.
>
> Under Rule 147, there is no limit on the size of the offering or
> number of purchasers.

######### [Regulation D---Private Placements]{.underline} 

> Another method of sale that avoids SEC registration is a private
> placement. In a **private placement**, an issuer offers securities to
> a select universe of potential buyers, often operat- ing on a much
> smaller scale for cost savings and faster access to capital. There is
> no public offering of the securities, and therefore they are not
> required to be SEC-registered.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Uber, a private company, can raise capital through a private placement
> by selling stock privately to investors such as Goldman Sachs and
> Fidelity.
>
> **Regulation D** of the '33 Act governs private placements and defines
> the types of permitted investors. All types of private placements
> allow for **accredited investors**, who are assumed to be
> sophisticated, i.e., knowledgeable about the securities industry.
> These include:

1.  Individuals with a net worth of at least \$1 million, excluding the
    value of their primary residence

2.  Individuals with income exceeding \$200,000 in each of the two most
    recent years, or joint income with a spouse exceeding \$300,000 for
    those years, and a reasonable expectation of the same income level
    in the current year

3.  Officers, partners, and directors of the issuer

4.  Institutional investors with \$5 million in assets

> Because they are sophisticated, an unlimited number of accredited
> investors can participate in a private placement.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> Anyone who is not defined as accredited is considered a
> **non-accredited investor**. Although in practice a number of
> different types of Reg D transactions with various requirements exist,
> for exam purposes it is important to know that, generally, a maximum
> of 35 non-accredited investors can participate in a private placement.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> Private placements allow a company to raise an unlimited amount of
> capital; however, for all private placements, restrictions apply on
> the resale of the securities, meaning they cannot be sold without
> registration or an applicable exemption.

######### [Rule 144---Restricted and Control Stock]{.underline} 

> **Rule 144** defines the conditions under which securities acquired
> through an exempt trans- action, or restricted from resale for other
> reasons, can be sold. It defines both restricted and control
> securities.

1.  ***Restricted Stock***

> **Restricted stock** is stock that has never been SEC-registered.
> Investors can receive restricted stock through private placements,
> employee stock benefit plans, compensation for profes- sional
> services, or in exchange for providing seed money or start-up capital
> to the company.
>
> Restricted stock must be held for a certain period of time before
> being sold. The holding period is a minimum of six months for
> securities issued by companies subject to reporting requirements of
> the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
>
> There must also be adequate current information about the issuer
> before the sale can be made. For example, securities of a private
> company that does not file financials would not be eligible for sale
> under Rule 144. Put differently, only shares of a **public company**
> can be sold through this rule.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Joe was a very early investor in Facebook, purchasing shares of
> Facebook in 2007. Therefore, Joe owned restricted shares of Facebook.
> In order to resell these shares to the general pub- lic, two things
> needed to happen: 1) Joe needed to hold the shares for at least six
> months and 2) Facebook needed to be a public company. Therefore, once
> Facebook conducted its IPO in 2012, Joe could freely sell his shares
> of Facebook into the public market because he had held these shares
> for well over six months and now Facebook is public.

2.  ***Control Stock***

> **Control stock** are shares held by an affiliate of the issuing
> company. An **affiliate**, also referred to as a **corporate
> insider**, is commonly defined as being either:

-   An officer of the company (e.g., CEO or CFO)

-   A member of the board of directors, or

-   An individual owning more than 10% of the voting shares

> A limit is imposed on the number of shares that an affiliate may sell
> during any three-month period. Over any 90-day period, the shares sold
> cannot exceed the greater of:

-   1% of the outstanding shares of the same class being sold, or

-   The average reported weekly trading volume during the four weeks
    preceding the sale

> If the securities being sold by the affiliate are also restricted, the
> holding period of six months also applies.
>

######### [Rule 144A---Qualified Institutional Buyers]{.underline} 

> **Rule 144A** allows unregistered securities to be sold to **qualified
> institutional buyers (QIBs)** without registration. To be a QIB, the
> institution must manage a securities portfolio of at least \$100
> million. Broker-dealers with a securities portfolio of at least \$10
> million are also considered QIBs.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> Rule 144A increases the liquidity of unregistered securities by
> enabling a more liquid and efficient institutional resale market. The
> most common uses of Rule 144A include the issu- ance of high-yield
> debt and the issuance of pre-IPO shares.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Uber, a private company, previously sold shares to Goldman Sachs
> through a Reg D private placement. If Goldman wants to cash out on its
> investment, it can freely sell the Uber shares to a QIB, such as
> Fidelity.

######### [Rule 145---Reclassification of Securities]{.underline} 

> **Rule 145** is designed to protect the shareholders of a company that
> proposes to reclas- sify its ownership structure, acquire another
> business, or merge with another company. The premise of Rule 145 is
> that investors are essentially being offered a new security in the
> joint company, so they are entitled to the same disclosures and
> protections as if it were a new securities offering, including that
> the securities be SEC-registered and the receipt of a prospectus.
>
> Three types of transactions are covered:

-   **Reclassifications**---A change that involves the substitution of
    > one security for another, except for a stock split, reverse stock
    > split, or change in par value. For example, an offer to swap one
    > class of debt security for another may be a reclassification.

-   **Mergers and acquisitions (M&A)**---Securities, generally the stock

    > (the target), usually to facilitate a combination of the two
    > issuers, for reasons other than a change in the issuer's location

-   **Transfers of assets**---Securities are issued to investors as
    > compensation for assets transferred from one company to another in
    > a transaction other than a full dissolution or pro-rata
    > distribution to all shareholders.

> **Exchange offers**, in which a company exchanges new debt or equity
> securities for its out- standing securities, often as part of a
> restructuring, may qualify for an exemption from registration under
> the '33 Act. To qualify, the old and new securities must have the same
> issuer, with no additional consideration paid by the securities
> holder. The offering must be limited to existing securities holders,
> with no remuneration paid for the exchange solicita- tion. Examples
> include stock splits and stock dividends.
>
> ***[8.2.6.1 Tender Offer]{.underline}***
>
> Exchange offers, discussed above, are a type of tender offer. Although
> **tender offers** are not specifically covered under Rule 145, SIE
> candidates must be familiar with them. A tender offer is an offer by
> the issuer or an outside investor to purchase at least 5% of the
> company's shares directly from company shareholders. The purchaser
> making the offer, whether it be the issuer itself or an outside
> investor, can attempt to purchase the shares using cash or securities.
> When securities are used, it is referred to as an **exchange offer**.
>
> Generally, to entice shareholders to sell, the purchaser will offer
> them a premium price over the current market price. For example, if
> their shares are worth \$20, shareholders might be offered \$23 to
> sell. Each individual shareholder must then decide whether to accept
> the terms and sell his shares. If a shareholder decides to sell, he
> can only sell up to the number of shares he owns. Put differently, an
> investor cannot short into a tender.
>
> ***Example***
>
> If Ben owns 1,000 shares of ABC Co., he can only sell 1,000 in a
> tender offer. He is not allowed more than the number of shares he
> owns.
>
> Additionally, the purchaser making the offer might qualify a tender
> with a minimum number of acceptable shares. This means that unless
> shareholders agree to sell a certain number of shares, the investor
> making the offer will not go through with any purchases.
>
> ***Example***
>
> XYZ Co. is looking to purchase up to 20 million shares of Cola Co.'s
> stock at a price of \$30 per share. ABC Co. sets a minimum threshold
> of 15 million shares. If the shareholders of Cola Co. only agree to
> tender 10 million shares collectively, ABC Co. will not go through
> with any purchases since the minimum threshold was not met.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> If a tender offer is oversubscribed, the shares are accepted
> proportionally from those share- holders who tendered.
>
> ***Example***
>
> If an investor seeks to purchase 10 million shares in a tender offer,
> but shareholders collec- tively tender 100 million shares, only 10% of
> each shareholder's shares would be accepted. If a shareholder tendered
> 1,000 shares, only 100 of their shares (10%) would actually be

#### Progress Check---Solutions {#progress-checksolutions-7 .unnumbered}

1.  (**D**) The term insiders includes all officers, directors, and
    shareholders owning more than 10% of a company.

2.  (**C**) The cooling-off period begins with the filing of a
    registration statement and ends on the effective date. During this
    period, a preliminary prospectus (red herring) can be sent and road
    shows can be conducted to drum up indications of interest. However,
    no offers or sale of shares are allowed until the effective date,
    which is the date the SEC permits sale.

3.  (**D**) The final prospectus must be delivered by the trade
    settlement date, which is T + 2. In this case, that is June 7.
    Clients can be pointed to where they can find an electronic version
    of the final prospectus, if two conditions are met. First, a valid
    final prospectus must have been filed with the SEC. Second, a timely
    notice must be sent to each purchaser indicating where to access the
    document online. "Timely" in this case means by settlement.

4.  (**A**) To resell restricted stock under Rule 144, the shares must
    be held for six months, and the issuer must be a public company.
    Therefore, Karen can sell the stock under Rule 144 once the company
    conducts its initial public offering (IPO), because the company will
    then be public and she will have met the six-month holding period.

5.  (**B**) Under Rule 144A, unregistered securities can be sold to
    QIBs, institutions that manage securities portfolios of *at least
    \$100 million*. However, broker-dealers with securities portfolios
    of at least \$10 million are also QIBs.

6.  (**B**) Private placements allow an issuer to raise an unlimited
    amount of capital. In doing so, there is no limit on the number of
    accredited investors that can participate, but there can only be a
    maximum of 35 non-accredited investors.

7.  (**D**) The SEC is responsible for clearing a company's securities
    for public sale and reviewing the registration statement to ensure
    all required information is included. However, they do not approve
    or disapprove of the securities or fact check the information in the
    registration statement.

8.  (**C**) The only advertisement permitted during the cooling-off
    period is a tombstone---in which the underwriter announces the deal
    and its key terms. The tombstone ad must be limited to certain facts
    about the deal and its participants, and it must state that shares
    *cannot* be purchased until the effective date.

###### Underwriting Process

> When companies want to register stocks and bonds and sell them to the
> public, they typi- cally enlist the help of an investment bank. A
> group of banks working together to market a deal is referred to as a
> **syndicate**. The syndicate will guide the company through the SEC-
> registration process and is responsible for marketing and ultimately
> selling the securities to the public.
>
> The remainder of this chapter will discuss the role investment bankers
> play in this process, as well as the various types of offerings they
> assist with, the different types of underwriting commitments they use,
> the responsibilities of each firm in the syndicate, how these firms
> are compensated, and their part in the post-issuance process.

######### [Types of Offerings]{.underline} 

> An issuer's sale of securities can be classified as either an
> **initial public offering (IPO)** or a **follow-on offering**.
>
> An IPO is the first public offering of a company's securities. It
> allows the issuer to publicly raise capital and might give private
> shareholders---founders, early employees, etc.---a pub- lic market for
> valuing and selling their stock. Investment bankers help private
> companies assess the best timing for IPOs along with the initial
> offering price that will attract sufficient investor enthusiasm.
>
> A follow-on offering occurs when an issuer that already has publicly
> traded securities sells additional stock to the public. These
> offerings raise additional equity capital for companies, or help large
> shareholders dispose of blocks of company stock, after the IPO.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Because Apple is a publicly traded company that has already had an
> IPO, if it does another stock offering, it would be considered a
> follow-on.
>
> Certain large companies that meet SEC requirements are allowed to
> conduct follow-on offerings using a **shelf registration**. Different
> from a normal registration, a shelf allows an issuer to pre-register
> equity or debt securities today and sell them at a later date. A shelf
> registration is valid for up to three years after the filing date and
> gives issuers the flexibility to raise capital in financial markets
> whenever conditions are most favorable, without the need for a
> separate registration or prospectus at that time.
>
> Shelf offerings can be used for both equity and debt securities;
> however, they are not per- mitted to be used for an IPO.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> Further classifications of offerings are:

-   **Primary offering---**A new issue in which the issuer sells shares
    and receives all the proceeds. In this situation, the company is
    creating brand new shares to sell.

-   **Secondary offering---**An offering in which a shareholder sells
    shares held in the issuing corporation, and proceeds of the offering
    belong to that shareholder. For example, a company's founder, an
    angel investor, or a venture capital firm liquidates a sizable
    position in the company. If a transaction is a secondary offering,
    the company's net worth will be unchanged, as all proceeds will be
    received by existing shareholders. No new shares are created in this
    scenario.

-   **Split offering**---A combination of primary and secondary
    offerings. This is very common, as large shareholders may choose to
    sell shares alongside the company in a registered offering.

> Typically, the prospectus cover's first paragraph will disclose
> whether the issue is an IPO or a follow-on and whether the shares are
> being offered by the company (i.e., primary), selling shareholders
> (i.e., secondary), or a combination of the two (i.e., split).
>
> ***Example***
>
> A company registers to sell the shares of a director (an existing
> shareholder) and a private equity shop (an existing shareholder), but
> does not register any primary (new) shares. The prospectus would
> identify this deal as a secondary offering, because only existing
> shareholders are selling.

######### [Choosing an Underwriter]{.underline} 

> Once the issuer decides to sell securities, it will select its
> underwriter through either a nego- tiated underwriting or a
> competitive bid process. In a **negotiated underwriting**, the terms
> of the offering are determined between the issuer and a single
> underwriter. The issuer will meet with a number of prospective
> underwriters and decide which it is most comfortable working with
> based on a variety of factors, such as pricing, sector expertise, and
> rapport. The process by which firms compete to win the mandate is
> called a **bake-off** or **pitch**.
>
> In a **competitive bid**, underwriters submit to the issuer sealed
> bids to sell the securities. The issuer awards the contract to the
> underwriter with the best price.
>
> Most corporate underwritings are structured through a negotiated
> process. Select munici- pal bond deals are awarded via a competitive
> bid.
>
> The terms and conditions of the public offering and the agreement
> between the issuer and the underwriter are formalized in a contract
> known as the **underwriting agreement**.

######### [Types of Underwriting Commitments]{.underline} 

> Once an underwriter is selected, there are different ways the
> underwriting can be structured. The most common type of underwriting
> is a **firm commitment**, in which the underwriters agree to purchase
> all shares that are to be offered and then resell them to the public.
> If part of the new issue goes unsold, those shares are distributed
> among the members of the syndicate. Put differently, the underwriters
> are taking on risk, as they are liable for any unsold shares.
>
> A **standby commitment** is a type of firm commitment that is used in
> conjunction with a rights offering. As discussed in a previous
> chapter, a **rights offering** allows current share- holders to
> maintain their proportionate ownership in the company if additional
> shares are issued. If current shareholders decide not to subscribe to
> this rights offering and purchase the additional shares, the
> underwriter standing by will purchase them and then look to resell
> them to the public. This arrangement ensures that all the shares will
> be sold either to existing shareholders or the underwriters.
>
> A **best efforts** is an underwriting agreement in which the
> underwriters attempt to sell all the securities but have no obligation
> to buy any unsold shares. These agreements are usually used for
> private placements and other offerings of risky securities.
>
> An **all-or-none** is one type of best efforts where if the
> underwriter is unable to sell all the shares within a certain period,
> the entire deal will be cancelled.
>
> A **minimum-maximum (mini-max)** is a type of best efforts where the
> deal will be cancelled unless a minimum amount is raised. Once the
> minimum threshold has been reached, it becomes a traditional best
> efforts underwriting.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities

######### [Underwriting Syndicate]{.underline} 

> In some situations, one broker-dealer is the sole underwriter for a
> new issue. In most circum- stances, however, securities are
> distributed through syndication, which is when a group of investment
> banks, known as an **underwriting syndicate**, agrees to work together
> to under- write the offering and share the risks of distributing it.
> Risk-sharing is especially important
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> on firm commitment offerings, in which underwriters purchase the
> securities from the issuer and then have responsibility for reselling
> them.

1.  ***Syndicate Manager and Members***

> The underwriting syndicate is led by a **lead underwriter**, or
> **managing underwriter**, who is the primary liaison for the issuer.
> In forming a syndicate, the lead underwriter invites other investment
> banks to participate in a joint distribution of the offering. These
> other **syndicate members** usually commit to distributing a certain
> percentage of the entire offering. The members share the risks of
> underwriting the issue with the managing underwriter and are held
> financially responsible for any unsold portions. The syndicate is a
> temporary group that dissolves after completion of the sale.
>
> The terms established between syndicate members are found in the
> **agreement among underwriters (AAU)**.

2.  ***Selling Group***

> A **selling group** is comprised of broker-dealers that sell an
> allotment of the newly issued securities on behalf of an underwriter
> or syndicate members. These firms differ from syn- dicate managers
> because they do not have liability for any unsold securities. Instead,
> the selling group acts as agents on the deal. The syndicate sells the
> securities to the selling group members at a mark-up from its price
> but still at a discount from the public offering price, and any shares
> they cannot distribute are returned to the underwriting syndicate. The
> **selected dealer agreement** stipulates the terms for the selling
> group.
>
> ***[8.3.4.3 Building a Book]{.underline}***
>
> Once this syndicate is bound together, their main responsibilities are
> to **build a book**, meaning market the offering to potential
> investors and collect indications of interest. This book-building
> process occurs during the cooling-off period, after the registration
> statement has been filed. Underwriters and selling group members can
> obtain IOIs through phone calls, in-person meetings with investors, or
> road show presentations. The goal is to drum up and ascertain demand
> for the offering as well as to determine where to price the new issue.
>
> Although orders cannot be confirmed during the cooling-off period,
> IOIs usually become orders when the deal is effective.

######### [Underwriting Compensation]{.underline} 

> The compensation to the syndicate in an underwriting is the
> **underwriting spread**. The **spread** is calculated as the
> difference between what the underwriters pay an issuing com- pany per
> share and the **public offering price (POP)**, which is the price the
> public must pay to purchase the securities. The size of the spread
> depends on the negotiations between underwriters and the company. The
> spread increases with the amount of risk the under- writers take on.
>
> ***Example***
>
> The syndicate buys stock from the issuer at \$40 a share and then
> offers it at an IPO price of \$43. The spread is \$3 per share.

######### [Restrictions on IPO Offerings]{.underline} 

> As the underwriters market and ultimately sell shares to investors
> starting on the effective date, there are some restrictions regarding
> the investors they can actually sell to. FINRA Rule 5130 is designed
> to protect the integrity of equity IPOs by requiring underwriters to
> make bona fide public offerings. Thus, the rule prohibits the sale of
> new issues to "restricted persons." Note that, although restricted
> persons cannot purchase an initial public offering, they are free to
> purchase the shares when they begin to trade in the secondary market.

######### Restricted Persons {#restricted-persons .unnumbered}

> The term **restricted person** is fairly expansive. It covers:

a.  FINRA member firms and their employees

b.  Finders and fiduciaries (e.g., attorneys and accountants) of the
    > managing underwriter

c.  Portfolio managers in their personal investment accounts, and

d.  Immediate family members of restricted persons

> Under this rule, family members are defined as a spouse, parents,
> in-laws, siblings, children, and anyone else to whom a restricted
> person provides material (i.e., financial) support. Material support
> is defined as providing more than 25% of a person's income.
>
> The definition of family member does not include aunts and uncles,

######### [Underwriter Post-Effective Date]{.underline} 

> Once the underwriters successfully sell shares on the effective date,

> Stabilization, which is one of the primary post-issuance
> responsibilities of the underwriter, is discussed below.

> ***[8.3.7.1 Stabilization]{.underline}***
>
> **Stabilization** allows the underwriter to bid on a new issue in the

###### Municipal Bond Underwriting

> This chapter has focused on the process of selling new issues of
> securities to investors, espe- cially through the lens of corporate
> offerings. Although municipal securities are exempt from registration,
> as previously mentioned, their underwriting process and the players
> involved are largely similar to what has been discussed, from the role
> of the underwriting syndicate members and the breakdown of the spread.
> However, some unique rules and characteristics apply to municipal bond
> underwritings, and SIE candidates should be familiar with these.

######### [Municipal Syndicate New-Issue Practices]{.underline} 

> MSRB Rule G-11 addresses practices that municipal firms must follow
> when involved in primary offerings of municipal securities.
>
> ***[8.4.1.1 Priority of Orders]{.underline}***
>
> A key aspect of Rule G-11 relates to the priority provisions that must
> be established within each municipal bond syndicate. These provisions
> detail that the syndicate must allocate the bonds to investors in a
> certain order, regardless of the sequence in which orders were
> received from customers. This priority is relevant if there are more
> orders from investors than there are bonds to be sold.
>
> These priority provisions are especially important in the context of
> municipal bonds. Unlike with corporate deals, for municipal bonds the
> syndicate can begin accepting orders prior to being awarded the
> underwriting business by the municipality. Having an established
> priority helps ensure fairness and that no investor receives
> specialized treatment.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> The standard order priority is:

1.  Presale orders

2.  Group orders

3.  Designated orders

4.  Member orders

######### Presale Orders {#presale-orders .unnumbered}

> **Presale orders** are entered *before* the syndicate is awarded the
> underwriting business. Presale customers are willing to commit to
> buying bonds without information on exact prices or yields. These
> orders are filled first, as they are most beneficial for the syndicate
> since they allow the underwriters to pitch for the business more
> aggressively, knowing that they will have orders in place if they do
> win the right to conduct the underwriting. All mem- bers of the
> syndicate will get a cut of presale orders based on their percentage
> participation in the underwriting.

######### Group Orders {#group-orders .unnumbered}

> These are the first orders that come in after the syndicate has been
> awarded the business, but prior to each syndicate member receiving its
> allocations of bonds to sell. Similar to pre- sale orders, proceeds of
> sales from **group orders** are placed in the syndicate account and
> allocated to all syndicate members based on their pro-rata
> participation in the syndicate.

######### Designated Orders {#designated-orders .unnumbered}

> **Designated orders** specify which syndicate member or members are to
> receive credit for the order. These orders are often placed by
> institutional customers. Designated orders have a lower priority, as
> they only benefit the firm that sold the bonds, rather than the
> syndicate as a whole.

######### Member Orders {#member-orders .unnumbered}

> The last of the orders to be filled are **member orders**. These are
> orders placed by members of the syndicate that wish to purchase for
> their own inventory or related accounts. Related accounts include
> investment portfolios and proprietary mutual funds. These have the
> lowest priority because they only benefit one particular firm within
> the syndicate.
>
> ***[8.4.1.2 Settlement of the Syndicate Account]{.underline}***
>
> After the issue is sold, the syndicate manager is responsible for
> settling the syndicate account and paying the syndicate members their
> owed profits according to their participation in the underwriting.
> Final settlement of the syndicate account must be completed within 30
> cal- endar days of the delivery of securities to the syndicate.

######### [SEC Rule 15c2-12]{.underline} 

> When corporate securities are sold to the public, investors must
> receive a prospectus, which details all material information about the
> issuer. Because municipal securities are exempt from registration, a
> prospectus is not required. In addition, although the MSRB regulates
>
> municipal securities professionals, it does not have the ability to
> directly regulate the issu- ers or require them to provide investors
> with relevant financial or other material informa- tion. However,
> because of the ongoing concern over disclosure of the financial
> condition of municipal issuers, SEC Rule 15c2-12 aims to deter fraud
> and manipulation in the municipal securities market by prohibiting the
> underwriting of and subsequent recommendation of securities for which
> adequate information is not available.
>
> This rule requires broker-dealers to ensure through a written
> agreement with the issuer that current information about municipal
> issuers and their securities is available to investors. The
> requirement is imposed on broker-dealers because the SEC, similar to
> the MSRB, is pro- hibited from imposing disclosure rules on issuers.
> Put differently, this rule is a roundabout way of regulating the
> issuers, through the regulation of the broker-dealers they do business
> with.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities

1.  ***Application of Rule 15c2-12 to Primary Offerings***

> The new-issue provisions of the rule require the underwriters to
> obtain, review, and distrib- ute to investors copies of the issuer's
> official statement. They must also file this information with the
> MSRB.

2.  ***Additional Requirements of Rule 15c2-12***

> Requirements are also imposed on broker-dealers to ensure that
> municipal issuer infor- mation is kept current after the underwriting
> is complete. Specifically, the rule bars bro- ker-dealers from
> engaging in a municipal securities underwriting unless the issuer has
> agreed in writing to provide continuing disclosure, such as annual
> financial information and material event notices. Again, this rule is
> imposed on broker-dealers because the SEC cannot regulate issuers of
> municipal securities.

######### Annual Financial Information {#annual-financial-information .unnumbered}

> Audited financial statements, if available, along with other financial
> information, are to be provided by the issuer, and must be submitted
> to the investing public on an annual basis. This helps investors
> analyze the financial health and operating condition of the issuer.

######### Material Event Notices {#material-event-notices .unnumbered}

> Updates of material information that may impact the issuer's financial
> condition must also be shared with the public. Examples include rating
> changes, defaults, and events affecting the tax-exempt status of the
> security.
>
> **Material event notices** must be submitted to the MSRB within 10
> business days of the event.

######### [New-Issue Documents and Information]{.underline} 

> As mentioned above, issuers are required to provide certain disclosure
> information to investors when new issues of municipal securities come
> to market. This is to ensure poten- tial municipal securities
> investors have access to sufficient information to make informed
> investment decisions. MSRB Rule G-32 legislates the type of
> information that must be pro- vided to investors no later than the
> settlement date of the transaction.
>
> *Chapter 8* Issuing Securities
>
> As mentioned, the primary disclosure document used for this purpose is
> the **official state- ment**, which is usually prepared on behalf of
> the issuer by its legal counsel and financial advisers. Official
> statements are subject to standard SEC disclosure requirements and
> must not include any untrue statements of material facts or omit
> material facts. The information included in the official statement is
> similar to what is found in a registration statement.
>
> Additionally, because the final version of the official statement is
> not generally available until the terms of the offering are finalized,
> a **preliminary official statement** can be used to provide investors
> with information about the new issue. The preliminary official
> statement serves a similar purpose as the preliminary prospectus, or
> red herring, discussed earlier in this chapter.
>
> Even if a preliminary official statement has been provided to
> investors, they must receive the final official statement when
> available.

######### [CUSIP Requirement for New Issues]{.underline} 

> CUSIP numbers are identification numbers assigned to all securities.
> They are essential in facilitating the good delivery of securities and
> ensuring that the securities that are delivered match those that were
> purchased. MSRB Rule G-34 addresses the application requirements for
> CUSIP numbers for new issues of municipal securities.
>
> Specifically, here are rules for assigning CUSIP numbers to new
> issues:

-   In a negotiated sale, the underwriter is responsible for requesting
    > the CUSIP number by pricing.

-   In a competitive sale, the municipal advisor should apply no later
    > than one business day after sending out the notice of sale, which
    > is a document that invites bids in a competitive deal. If there is
    > no advisor, then the underwriter must apply immediately after
    > receiving notification of the award from the issuer.

    commitment deal?

    A.  All that are not sold to the public

    B.  All that are not sold to the public, up to a predetermined limit

    wants to get in on the IPO of a hot tech company. Can he participate
    in the IPO? If he cannot, can his spouse, Mary?

    A.  Both Kevin and Mary can participate.

    B.  Kevin can't participate, but Mary can.

    C.  Mary can participate only if she buys shares in an individual
        account, not a joint account.

    D.  Neither can participate.

15. Donald is a restricted person for purposes of a hot IPO, but he
    really wants to get some shares. So, he puts in an order to buy
    shares in the name of his 15-year-old son, a dependent. Is this

    A.  Only if Donald and the son jointly own the account

    B.  Only if the son agrees to hold the shares for at least six

        account

16. In what type of underwriting do the underwriters act as agents, with
    no financial responsibility for any unsold securities?

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-7 .unnumbered}

1.  (**B**) The prospectus is the most important disclosure document
    given to investors. A copy must be given to each prospectus
    investor, at or prior to the initial purchase of an offering in the
    primary market.

2.  (**D**) The pre-filing period occurs prior to the filing of a
    registration statement with the SEC. In this phase, there can be no
    marketing of the securities, no advertising, and no offers or sales
    to the public. Legally, the offering does not yet exist.

3.  (**B**) During the cooling-off period, underwriters are allowed to
    solicit indications of interest (IOIs), which are nonbinding
    indications that investors may be interested in buying shares. It is
    these IOIs, especially from large institutions, that carry the most
    weight in setting the initial offering price. The financial needs of
    the issuer and road show attendance can also have some influence.

4.  (**C**) Securities exempt from SEC registration requirements include
    US government and agency securities, municipal bonds, securities
    issued by nonprofits, commercial paper, and commercial bank
    securities. All other securities are non-exempt, meaning they must
    be SEC registered.

5.  (**B**) To qualify under Rule 147, all securities must be sold to
    state residents. Even one out-of- state investor can jeopardize the
    exemption. Shares may not be resold to out-of-state buyers for at
    least six months.

6.  (**D**) Individuals can meet Reg D accredited investor tests based
    on *either* income or net worth. The net worth test of \$1 million
    is always for one person and excludes the

> value of a primary residence. The income test effectively takes into
> account three years (the current year and the last two) and can be met
> on an individual or joint-with- spouse basis. It is \$200,000 for an
> individual and \$300,000 with a spouse.

7.  (**C**) Regulation D typically allows an unlimited number of
    accredited and a maximum of 35 non-accredited investors to
    participate in a private placement.

8.  (**C**) The maximum amount of control stock an affiliate can sell in
    a 90-day period is the greater of 1% of outstanding shares or the
    average reported weekly trading volume in the four weeks preceding
    the sale. In this case, 1% of one million shares (10,000) is
    greater.

9.  (**C**) A shelf-registration allows a large public issuer to file a
    registration statement that can cover several follow-on offerings of
    equity or debt securities at a later date. On the registration, the
    issuer leaves the offering dates and amounts blank. Offerings may
    then be made for up to three years under one shelf registration.

10. (**B**) A split offering combines features of a primary offering, in
    which the company sells shares and receives proceeds, and a
    secondary offering, in which shareholders sell shares and receive
    proceeds. This is common when insiders and affiliates wish to take
    advantage of an IPO to cash out their shares.

> *Chapter 8:* Issuing Securities

#### Unit Exam---Solutions (Continued) {#unit-examsolutions-continued-7 .unnumbered}

11. (**C**) Standby offerings are made in conjunction with rights
    offerings. The company authorizes shares for purchase by current
    shareholders, to help them maintain proportionate ownership under a
    rights offering. The shares not bought by shareholders are absorbed
    by the underwriters.

12. (**B**) A firm commitment often represents too big of a risk for any
    one firm to take on. The financial strength of the full underwriting
    syndicate usually stands behind it. Members of the selling group are
    broker-dealers (not necessarily investment bankers) who agree to
    distribute shares to customers, but they do not take on the
    financial risks of the offering.

13. (**C**) A shelf registration allows an issuer to preregister debt
    and/or equity securities today and sell them at a later date when
    market conditions are favorable. A shelf is good for up to three
    years and can only be used for a follow-on offering, never for an
    IPO.

14. (**D**) Restricted persons cannot participate in IPOs, and both
    Kevin and Mary are restricted persons, as immediate family members
    of a FINRA firm employee. A restricted family member includes a
    spouse, parent, in-law, sibling, and child. Kevin is a child and
    Mary is an in-law of the FINRA firm employee.

15. (**C**) Immediate family members of restricted persons, including
    spouses, siblings, children, and in-laws, are also restricted and
    cannot purchase an IPO of common stock.

16. (**A**) Most underwritings are firm commitments, in which the
    underwriting syndicate buys shares from the issuer and resells them
    to the public. The syndicate has the risk for unsold shares. In a
    best efforts basis, the underwriters do not buy shares and have no
    legal responsibility for unsold shares.

### The Secondary Market and Equity Trading

> The **secondary market** is where investors can buy and sell
> securities directly with one another. The depth and liquidity of the
> secondary market is one of the primary reasons that the US capital
> markets are so attractive to issuers and investors alike. This chapter
> will address the main markets where equities trade and the different
> rules governing those mar- ketplaces. We will also look at how firms
> that are the intermediaries between customers and the equities markets
> serve their clients and the different order types available to
> customers when trading securities.

###### The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ('34 Act)

> The **Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ('34 Act)** regulates the
> secondary market, including the US financial markets and their
> participants, requiring that participants be registered. All US
> exchanges and over-the-counter markets are subject to the SEC's
> oversight, as are broker-dealers and their representatives who
> transact securities business. It regulates the purchase, sale, and
> exchange of securities in the capital markets. One of the most
> significant parts of the '34 Act is its **anti-fraud provisions**,
> which specify that firms and representatives cannot use any act,
> practice, or course of business for fraud or the deception of any
> inves- tor. Included in these prohibitions are untrue statements of
> material fact and omissions or misrepresentations of material facts.
>
> Essentially, the anti-fraud provisions provide that firms and their
> representatives shouldn't lie, cheat, or steal.

######### [Fraudulent Activities]{.underline} 

> The '34 Act forbids all forms of direct or indirect manipulation of
> securities prices. These prohibitions apply to both securities that
> are registered and exempt securities.
>
> An investor who has been injured due to the price manipulation of
> others is entitled to sue for damages and costs. A suit must be
> brought against an alleged violator within three years of the
> manipulative activity and within one year of discovery. These time
> limits are referred to as the **statute of limitations**.

######### Misrepresentations and Material Information

> The '34 Act specifies that firms and representatives cannot use any
> act, practice, or course of business for fraud or deception of any
> investor. Included in these prohibitions are untrue statements of
> material fact, and omissions or misrepresentations of material facts.
> **Material information** makes a difference to an investor when making
> a decision. Investors must have access to the material information
> necessary for making investment decisions. Intentionally withholding
> material facts is as misleading as intentionally misstating them.

###### Activities of Broker-Dealers

> **Broker-dealers** are in the business of buying and selling
> securities for themselves and their clients, including retail and
> institutional investors. Broker-dealers execute transactions as
> **brokers**, matching willing counterparties, or as **dealers**,
> trading against their customers.
>
> Because a fundamental goal of securities laws is to prevent
> manipulation, which undermines fairness and independence in the
> markets, as the gatekeepers to the markets, broker-dealers are subject
> to considerable regulation governing how they conduct business, the
> fees they can charge, the disclosures they must make, and the rules
> they must follow.

######### Market-Making

> A **market maker** is a special type of broker-dealer that has agreed
> to "make a market" in a particular stock. Making a market means that
> the broker-dealer agrees to be ready and willing to buy and sell a
> particular security at its quoted prices during normal market hours
> (9:30 am--4:00 pm). When a firm becomes a market maker, it is entitled
> to certain benefits in the market, but it also takes on obligations.
>
> ***[9.2.1.1 Executing as a Dealer]{.underline}***
>
> Broker-dealers (BDs) acting in a **dealer capacity** (or **principal
> capacity**) trade for their own accounts. This is sometimes referred
> to as **position trading**. In doing so, they buy securities to hold
> in inventory or sell securities from their inventory. By holding
> securities ready for sale and capital ready to deploy, broker-dealers
> add liquidity to the markets and facilitate near-instantaneous
> transactions.
>
> The fee broker-dealers charge clients when acting in a dealer capacity
> is a **mark-up** when the BD is selling or a **mark-down** when the BD
> is buying. The mark-up or mark-down is a broker-dealer's profit on a
> trade. When executing transactions on a dealer or principal basis, the
> firm does not charge a commission.
>
> The chart below illustrates the transaction when a firm trades as a
> dealer:

> ***Example***
>
> A customer contacts a market maker to buy 1,000 shares of MSFT. The
> market maker exe- cutes the trade by selling the customer 1,000 shares
> of MSFT stock from its own inventory. If MSFT's market value was \$100
> per share when the order was entered, the firm would mark up the price
> of the shares (e.g., to \$101 per share), which compensates the firm
> for providing the brokerage service. Had the client entered an MSFT
> sell order, the firm exe- cuting a principal trade would mark down the
> price (e.g., to \$99 per share) and pay slightly less than the market
> value, which again compensates the broker-dealer for providing the
> execution service. The mark-up or mark-down is the entire fee the
> broker-dealer earns, and the client would not pay a commission in this
> circumstance.
>
> ***[9.2.1.2 Executing as a Broker]{.underline}***
>
> Broker-dealers acting in a **brokerage capacity** (or **agency
> capacity**) match willing buy- ers and sellers with one another.
> Unlike in dealer or principal trades, in agency trades, the
> broker-dealer does not purchase or own the underlying security;
> instead it matches the two counterparties on agreeable terms, and the
> trade is executed. On the settlement date, ownership of and title to
> the securities are transferred to the buyer, and the sale proceeds are
> transferred to the seller.
>
> The fee broker-dealers charge clients when acting in an agency
> capacity is a **commission**.
>
> Notice that in an agency trade, there must be two market participants
> (other than the bro- ker-dealer) willing to transact on the same terms
> at the same time. The chart below details a transaction where a firm
> acts as an agent.

> ***Example***
>
> Joe contacts Broker-Dealer A to buy 300 shares of IBM. Jane contacts
> Broker-Dealer A to sell the 300 shares of IBM stock that she currently
> owns. The broker-dealer will connect Joe and Jane and set a price
> acceptable to both of them. When trading as agent, the bro- ker-dealer
> is facilitating a trade between two counterparties rather than
> participating as one. Here, both Joe and Jane will pay Broker-Dealer A
> for the execution service it provided in the form of a trading
> commission (e.g., \$25 per trade).

3.  ***Hidden Profits***

> Broker-dealers cannot be both a broker and a dealer in the same
> transaction. This is defini- tional: if a firm is a broker, matching a
> buyer and seller, it cannot also be a participant in the trade. If the
> firm is a dealer, trading against the customer, it cannot also be
> matching two parties to a trade. Charging a client both fees in the
> same transaction is a violation.

4.  ***Fair Prices and Commissions***

> In addition to prohibiting hidden profits, both MSRB Rule G-30 and
> FINRA Rule 2120 require firms to buy or sell at fair prices to
> customers and charge reasonable commissions to cli- ents.
> Specifically, when determining fees, firms must take into account a
> number of factors, including:

-   The type of security involved

-   Their right to make a profit (for principal trades)

-   The availability of the security in the market. Charges should not
    be as high for easily accessible securities.

-   The dollar size of the transaction. Customers should receive some
    consideration for larger orders.

-   Services rendered by the firm, and

-   The expense involved in filling the order

> While the MSRB shares no specific percentages considered fair and
> reasonable, **FINRA's 5% policy** does provide such a guide.
> Specifically, the policy helps to determine the maximum amount of
> mark-up or commission that can be applied to a trade. However, this
> policy is a guide, not a hard-and-fast rule, meaning a firm can charge
> more than 5% based on the specific circumstances of the trade. For
> example, a very risky trade, an illiquid security, or an expensive
> order to fill are all potential reasons for charging more than 5%.

###### US Equity Market Structure

> In the US, secondary-market trading of equities takes place on
> securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. This
> section will address the operations, rules, and characteristics of
> these various marketplaces.

######### [Stock Exchanges]{.underline} 

> The main function of a stock exchange is to facilitate the buying and
> selling of securities. Companies that issue equity choose the exchange
> on which to list their stock. The two main national exchanges are the
> **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)** and **Nasdaq**.
>
> Both exchanges provide issuers and investors **liquidity**, which is
> the ability to quickly and easily sell securities. In addition,
> exchanges act as clearinghouses for each transaction, guar- anteeing
> payment to the seller, delivering the purchased shares to the buyer,
> and automati- cally reporting transaction data to the appropriate
> reporting facility. These services reduce risk and complexity for
> market participants.

> *Chapter 9*

######## The Secondary Market and Equity Trading {#the-secondary-market-and-equity-trading-5 .unnumbered}

> Both exchanges publish a variety of initial and ongoing financial and
> liquidity requirements that issuers must meet, such as minimum 1)
> stock price, 2) number of shareholders, and 3) total assets. To
> protect investors and the larger securities marketplace, if a company
> does not meet the appropriate criteria, the exchange has the authority
> to deny initial listing or expel an already-listed company.

######### New York Stock Exchange

> The New York Stock Exchange is the world's largest stock exchange.
> Trading on the NYSE is conducted in an **auction marketplace** where
> the current market price is the highest amount any buyer is willing to
> pay and the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell. In
> addition to the physical trading that occurs on the floor of the
> exchange, the NYSE simul- taneously conducts the electronic trading of
> those same securities. The NYSE argues that this dual-method
> approach---human trading on the floor and electronic trading---makes
> for the fairest, most efficient, and liquid market.

1.  ***Designated Market Makers (DMMs)***

> On the trading floor, the trading is directed and supervised by human
> **designated market makers (DMMs)**, previously known as
> **specialists**. Each NYSE-listed security has exactly *one* DMM
> assigned to oversee its trading. This role requires the DMM to
> maintain fair and orderly markets for each of its securities. This
> entails reviewing the trading data from both the physical and
> electronic venues and providing market participants with accurate and
> up-to-date liquidity and pricing data. The DMM has special importance
> during the market open, the market close, and periods of heightened
> volatility, as this human oversight can prevent and correct unusual or
> abnormal trading activity.
>
> The NYSE's approach of using human and electronic resources is
> different from that of Nasdaq, which operates exclusively in an
> electronic manner (i.e., without any DMM-like figure).

######### Nasdaq Stock Market

> Nasdaq was the world's first electronic stock exchange and is
> currently the second largest stock market in the world behind the
> NYSE. Nasdaq has no central trading location. Instead, all
> transactions occur electronically, and consequently there can be many
> market makers per security. This contrasts with the NYSE, which, as
> mentioned above, has exactly one DMM per stock.

2.  ***Nasdaq Quotation Requirements***

> On Nasdaq, broker-dealers act as market makers for various stocks.
> Nasdaq is said to be a **negotiated marketplace**, as market makers
> must post quotations to trade. These market makers post bid and ask
> prices for shares during market hours in the stocks for which they
> make a market.

-   The **bid** is the price a market maker will pay to buy shares from
    sellers.

-   The **ask** (also referred to as the **offer**) is the price at
    which a market maker will sell securities to willing buyers.

> Market makers have a **two-sided obligation**, meaning they must be
> willing to buy and sell on a continuous basis during regular market
> hours. These quotes are **firm quotes** because the market maker is
> required to trade at its quoted price if a counterparty presents an
> order against its quote. For example, if a market maker is quoting
> "27.10--27.20," that means the market maker must be willing to buy
> shares (its bid) at 27.10 and must be ready and able to sell shares
> (its offer or ask) at 27.20. The 10-cent difference between the bid
> and ask is referred to as the **bid**--**ask spread**.
>
> A firm, two-sided quote is required during normal market hours and
> must be for at least one **round lot**, meaning 100 shares or a
> multiple of 100 shares. After each trade execution, the firm must
> refresh its quote to update the price and the number of shares. The
> chart below illustrates what a market maker's quote looks like.

######### [Over-the-Counter (OTC) Markets]{.underline} 

> If an issuer does not qualify to list its securities on a national
> exchange, or chooses not to, it may still register and sell its shares
> under the **Securities Act of 1933** to the public. These non-exchange
> securities, sometimes referred to as **OTC securities**, are
> **unlisted** and trade over-the-counter (OTC). **OTC equities** are
> often less liquid, as fewer shares are traded and there is no
> centralized venue (e.g., an exchange) where all buyers and sellers
> trans- act. Therefore, the bid--ask spreads are often much wider than
> those of stocks trading on exchanges, indicating increased volatility.
> OTC equities do have quotation venues, such as the OTCBB and the OTC
> Markets, that display quotes of OTC market makers who stand ready and
> willing to trade such shares.
>
> ***[9.3.4.1 OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB)]{.underline}***
>
> The **OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB)** is a FINRA-operated quotation
> service that displays real- time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume
> information in over-the-counter equity securities. OTCBB securities
> include regional and foreign equity issues, warrants, American
> depositary receipts (ADRs), and direct participation programs (DPPs).
>
> Issuers that are quoted on the OTCBB are not subject to the
> significant listing criteria required by the national exchanges. For
> example, no minimum stock price or minimum number of shareholders is
> required. Once an issuer has met the basic requirements as set forth
> in the securities laws---registered shares under '33 and ongoing
> disclosures under '34 (i.e., continuing disclosures in 10-Ks and
> 10-Qs)---the security can be quoted in the OTCBB marketplace.
>
> *Chapter 9*

######## The Secondary Market and Equity Trading {#the-secondary-market-and-equity-trading-8 .unnumbered}

> To be quoted, however, there must be at least one market maker willing
> to enter quotes. Put differently, on the OTCBB, if there are no market
> makers, there are no quotes, so to be quoted, at least one firm must
> have agreed to be a market maker in that stock.
>
> ***[9.3.4.2 OTC Markets]{.underline}***
>
> ![](media/image15.png)**OTC Markets**, also referred to as **OTC
> Pink**, formerly known as the **Pink Sheets**, is a second electronic
> quotation system for OTC securities. The name "Pink Sheets" originates
> from the color of the paper on which these quotes were historically
> printed. A screen shot of an OTC Pink quote can be seen here.
>
> *Chapter 9*

######## The Secondary Market and Equity Trading {#the-secondary-market-and-equity-trading-9 .unnumbered}

> The OTC Pink has no formal listing requirements, and many of the
> quoted companies are closely held, extremely small, or thinly traded.
> One significant difference between the two venues is that the OTC Pink
> does not require quoted companies to file periodic reports or audited
> financial statements with the SEC (i.e., '34 disclosures). This can
> make it difficult for investors to find reliable, objective
> information on certain issuers.
>
> If a market maker is quoting prices for the same security on multiple
> OTC venues, FINRA Rule 6438 requires the quoted prices to be the same.
> For example, a firm cannot have a bid of \$1.05 on the OTC Pink for
> Security A, while simultaneously having a bid of \$1.12 on a dif-
> ferent OTC venue for Security A.

######### [Other Equity Marketplaces]{.underline} 

> Aside from national exchanges and OTC markets, securities trade on
> additional markets.

1.  ***Third Market***

> The **third market** refers to over-the-counter trading of
> exchange-traded securities. This type of trading, where listed
> securities will trade on an exchange other than their primary listing
> venue, is common. Trading in the third market is not good or bad;
> saying a listed security is trading in the third market is simply a
> way to describe how that security is trading.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Charlie places an order to buy shares of an NYSE-listed stock with his
> broker-dealer. The broker-dealer takes Charlie's order, and instead of
> routing it to the NYSE, it routes it to another broker-dealer, which
> makes a market in that stock and can fill Charlie's order from its own
> inventory. Because the order was filled by the OTC market maker, and
> not on the NYSE itself, this is described as a third-market
> transaction. In terms of pricing and liquidity, Charlie will receive a
> price that is as good as or better than what was available on the
> NYSE. Had the firm obtained a worse price for Charlie, the transaction
> would have been a best-execution violation (discussed later).

2.  ***Electronic Communications Networks (ECNs)***

> Sometimes referred to as the **fourth market**, **electronic
> communications networks (ECNs)** are passive computer systems that act
> as agents, automatically matching their members' buy and sell orders.
> They can operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and offer the
> possibility of lower fees than traditional brokerage, as minimal human
> interaction is involved in executing the trades.
>
> ECNs only accept orders from their subscribers, which are typically
> broker-dealers or large institutional traders. If a match can be made,
> orders will be automatically executed against each other.

#### Progress Check---Solutions {#progress-checksolutions-8 .unnumbered}

1.  (**B**) The third market is where exchange-listed securities trade
    over-the-counter.

2.  (**B**) For trades made in a dealer capacity (from inventory),
    dealers charge either a mark-up or mark-down. They mark up
    securities that they sell and mark down securities that they buy.
    Investors pay the mark-up on purchases and the mark-down on sales.
    Commissions don't apply on principal trades.

3.  (**A**) At the NYSE, trading is directed and supervised by
    designated market makers (DMMs). Each NYSE-listed security has one
    DMM assigned. In the past, the NYSE called persons in this role
    specialists.

4.  (**B**) Nasdaq market makers have a two-sided obligation, meaning
    they must stand ready to buy and sell a minimum of 100 shares at the
    quoted price.

5.  (**B**) The failure of a Nasdaq market maker to honor either side of
    a firm, two-sided quote is called backing away, and it is a
    violation of FINRA rules. In fact, it is a serious violation because
    it undermines fairness and market efficiency, while also potentially
    costing customers money, as in this example.

6.  (**D**) At any time, several Nasdaq market makers may post quotes on
    a security. The combination of the highest bid and lowest ask price
    from any market maker is the inside market. It defines what
    investors see as the current consolidated quote.

7.  (**B**) To be quoted on the OTC Markets, a security must have at
    least one market maker. Without any market makers, there would be no
    quotes.

8.  (**A**) A trade in an exchange-listed security routed to an OTC
    market maker is called a third- market trade. The main reason this
    is done is to obtain best execution, for a client. It cannot be done
    for the purpose of helping a dealer earn a mark-up or mark-down.

######  Customer Order Types

> When entering a securities transaction, firms must indicate whether
> the client wishes to buy, sell, or **sell short**.
>
> A **buy order** indicates the customer wishes to purchase, or acquire,
> securities. A **sell order** indicates the customer wishes to sell, or
> liquidate, securities. As discussed previously, a **short sale** is a
> sell order entered by a customer who does not own the securities being
> sold.
>
> Beyond simply buying, selling, or selling short, investors can make
> use of several different order types to execute trades. By using order
> instructions, customers can guide the trading process so that orders
> are entered and executed based on specific objectives. This section
> covers the most common types of order instructions.

######### [Order Tickets]{.underline} 

> Upon receiving an order from a customer, a firm must complete an
> **order ticket** or **order memorandum**. The order ticket captures
> and relays the customer's instructions and con- ditions for the order.
> Some of the key terms recorded on the order ticket include:

-   Type of order (buy, sell, or sell short)

-   The terms and conditions of the order (e.g., market order, limit
    order, stop order)

-   The account number

-   How the order was received

-   Whether the order was solicited, unsolicited, or placed on a
    discretionary basis

-   The time the order was received and then entered for execution

> This information must be captured and recorded to allow the firm and
> regulators to review order-handling and execution in the event of
> complaints, disputes, or irregularities.
>
> A sample order ticket appears below:

> ![](media/image16.png){width="3.830594925634296in" height="2.52625in"}

######### [Market Orders]{.underline} 

> A **market order** instructs the executing broker-dealer to buy or
> sell a specified quantity of securities *immediately*, at whatever
> price is available when the order reaches the market. It will be
> executed at the best available bid or ask at that time. The
> instruction assures full execution, but the execution price is
> unknown. Market orders have priority over all other types of orders.
>
> *Chapter 9*

######## The Secondary Market and Equity Trading {#the-secondary-market-and-equity-trading-11 .unnumbered}

> Market orders generally work best for small trades in liquid stocks,
> when immediate execu- tion is more important than the specific price
> of the trade. They don't work as well for large trades, illiquid
> securities, or when a specific price is desired.

######### [Limit Orders]{.underline} 

> **Limit orders** allow customers to buy or sell a specified quantity
> of shares at a specific price or better. When buying, "or better"
> means a lower price. When selling, "or better" means a higher price.
> While a customer could give an instruction to "buy 100 shares at \$25
> limit," the same instruction can be provided using commonplace
> language: a customer who contacts her rep with the instruction to "buy
> 100 shares at \$25" is placing a limit order. It is the rep's
> responsibility to interpret the customer's instruction and map it to
> the correct type of order.
>
> For example, Carolyn places an order to "buy 200 shares of Microsoft
> at \$50.63." What she has indicated is that a price of \$50.63 or
> better, which is any price at or lower than \$50.63, is
> acceptable---this is a limit order, even though she never said
> "limit." If, in fact, the order gets filled at \$50.61, Carolyn should
> be pleased, as she was willing to pay up to \$50.63 but was able to
> buy the shares for less.
>
> Evan is selling Microsoft stock, and his order is to "sell 200 shares
> at \$50.65 or better." He is saying: "I don't want to accept a cent
> less than \$50.65 for my shares, but I will accept \$50.65 or more."
> This, again, is a limit order instruction, even though Evan never said
> "limit."
>
> Once a customer has entered a limit order, the order will be executed
> as soon as it can be filled at its specified price. It is important to
> be able to identify when, in a series of transac- tions, a limit order
> would be executed.
>
> Consider the following trades:

+-------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

> *Chapter 9*

######## The Secondary Market and Equity Trading {#the-secondary-market-and-equity-trading-12 .unnumbered}

> Here, Carolyn's buy limit \$50.63 will fill at \$50.62 because that is

> Where along this sequence would Evan's **sell limit** \$50.65 be

> Let's say that Michael also entered a limit order to buy at \$50.40.
> Where along the above sequence would his order be executed? Answer:
> His order would not be executed because there is no price at or below

> Most orders, including limit orders, are **day orders**, meaning they

> However, customers can instead specify their order be **good 'til

> or cancelled (i.e., longer than a day).

######### [Stop Orders]{.underline} 

> **Stop orders**, sometimes called **stop loss orders**, are used to
> initiate a trade once a security's price reaches a specified point.
> They can be useful for protecting profits or preventing losses in a
> long stock or short stock position.
>
> Unlike limit orders, which are executed at the first price that
> satisfies the limit, stop orders have a two-step process. First, they
> are entered with a **stop price**, which is the market value that will
> activate or trigger the stop order. Second, once the predetermined
> price is reached, the stop order is automatically converted into a
> market order to buy or sell, and will imme- diately execute at the
> market price.
>
> ***Example 1: Protect Profit on a Long Stock Position***
>
> John buys 500 shares of Intel stock at \$27 per share, and over the
> next few weeks, it rises to \$31. He would like to protect his profits
> while continuing to participate in any upside to the stock price. He
> could do so by entering a **sell stop order** at \$29. If the price
> falls to \$29, his stop order will convert into a market order, and
> the shares will be immediately sold at the best available price. In
> this case, he will protect about \$2 worth of profit, depending on the
> exact execution price once triggered.

######### [Adjusting Limit and Stop Orders]{.underline} 

> ![](media/image12.png)As discussed previously, on the morning of the
> **ex-dividend date**, the stock price is reduced by the amount of the
> dividend. As the price of the stock falls, all orders entered at or
> below the market (i.e., "BLiSS" orders) are automatically reduced by
> the amount of the dividend to prevent inadvertent execution of these
> orders.

> ***Example***
>
> XYZ Corp stock has a market value of \$50 per share. Barry enters a
> buy limit order to pur- chase 100 shares of XYZ Corp at \$45. Around
> the same time, Michelle enters an order to sell 100 shares of XYZ
> \$47.50 stop. Weeks later, XYZ declares a \$1.25 cash dividend. What
> happens on the ex-date?
>
> Both Barry's buy limit order and Michelle's sell stop order (BLiSS)
> will be reduced by
>
> \$1.25. Why? The limit and stop prices are reduced to avoid the
> ex-date adjustment from triggering the orders.

-   Barry's order is now buy 100 shares XYZ at \$43.75 (buy limit).

-   Michelle's order is now sell 100 shares XYZ at \$46.25 stop (sell
    > stop).

> Note: If either order had been entered above the market, they would
> not be adjusted.
>
> Investors who do not want their orders adjusted can provide a **do not
> reduce (DNR)** instruction. This instruction means that the limit or
> stop price will not be reduced on the ex-dividend date, even if that
> results in an order's execution.

###### Market Protection

> The US securities markets are overseen and regulated by many entities,
> including Congress, the SEC, FINRA, and the exchanges. While each of
> these entities focuses on different areas of the marketplace, the
> overarching goal is to protect investors, ensure efficient and fair
> markets, and facilitate capital formation. This section will focus on
> a number of additional
>
> regulations that are designed to ensure that market makers act fairly
> and appropriately when dealing with customers.

######### Best Execution Obligations

> Firms must obtain **best execution** for customer orders. This means
> that the firm must route each customer order to the exchange or
> trading venue that will provide the most advanta- geous terms for the
> customer. This is often based on the best price, though other factors,
> such as volatility and liquidity, may be considered. As set forth in
> FINRA Rule 5310 and MSRB Rule G-18, members and their associated
> persons must:

-   Use reasonable diligence to determine the best market for the
    subject security, and

-   Execute transactions at prices as favorable as possible under
    prevailing market conditions

> ***Example***
>
> Shares of Company XYZ are offered for \$10 on the NYSE and \$10.10 on
> Nasdaq. If a bro- ker-dealer buys the shares for the customer at the
> higher price on Nasdaq, it is not fulfill- ing best execution
> responsibilities.
>
> These requirements exist in both agency and principal trades, and
> firms are required to regularly and rigorously review their procedures
> for meeting their best execution duty.
>
> ***[9.5.1.1 Interpositioning]{.underline}***
>
> **Interpositioning** is a violation of a firm's best execution
> responsibilities in which the firm adds an additional broker-dealer as
> a principal to a transaction when there is no benefit to the customer.
> This might be done to generate additional fees from the customer.

######### Order-Splitting and Trade-Shredding

> FINRA Rule 5290 prohibits firms from **order-splitting**, or
> **trade-shredding**, for the primary purpose of increasing monetary
> payments. Order-splitting is the practice of splitting a cus- tomer's
> order into multiple small orders for execution.
>
> ***Example***
>
> It would be prohibited for a firm to split a 1,000-share order into 10
> orders of 100 shares so that the firm could charge the customer a
> higher commission on each individual part of the order.
>
> An order may be broken apart for legitimate reasons---for example, if
> the firm believes that smaller orders will receive better and faster
> execution.

######### Publication of Transactions and Quotations

> FINRA Rule 5210 and MSRB Rule G-13 prohibit a firm from publishing or
> circulating security quotations or transaction reports unless it
> believes that quote or execution to be **bona fide**, meaning
> legitimate. As one would expect, it is fraudulent for a firm to make
> up information.
>
> For this reason, when an equity transaction does occur, the trade
> price and volume must be reported to the appropriate facility within
> 10 seconds of execution. These trade reports help keep all market
> participants informed, allowing them to access and integrate current
> market data into their own investment strategies.
>
> The MSRB has similar regulations, though MSRB Rule G-14 requires
> trades in municipal securities to instead be reported within 15
> minutes of execution to the MSRB's **Real-Time Transaction Reporting
> System (RTRS)**.

######### Payments by Firms to Influence the Market Price of Securities

> To prevent impropriety and misconduct, FINRA Rule 5230 prohibits firms
> from offering or giving payments or anything else of value to any
> media publication, such as a newspaper or radio program, in order to
> influence the price of a security. FINRA deems this activity
> manipulative, though some exceptions exist, including communications
> that are clearly identified as paid advertising as well as research
> reports.

######### Coordination and Anti-Intimidation

> To facilitate robust and fair markets, broker-dealers, market makers,
> and market partici- pants must set their quotes independently. FINRA
> Rule 5240 prohibits any attempt to coor- dinate prices, quotes, or
> trade reports between two or more firms, associated persons, and
> investors, or with anyone else. This also prohibits members from
> directing, requesting, or threatening another member to alter a price
> or quote.

######### Payments for Market Making

> Broker-dealers must use their business judgment to decide whether to
> make a market in a particular stock. The decision to do so must be
> based on valid and legitimate reasons. FINRA Rule 5250 prohibits a
> firm from accepting any direct or indirect payment from an issuer of a
> security or their affiliates in return for publishing a quote or
> acting as a market maker.
>
> ***Example***
>
> ABC Corp offers to pay a college tuition for a trader's child if the
> trader agrees to make a market in the stock. This is not allowed.
>
> Such payments create conflicts of interest because they can
> influence 1) the firm's decision to make a market in a security and 2)
> which prices are quoted. A payment, for this purpose, can include
> cash, non-cash, or securities.

######### [Front-Running]{.underline} 

> Under FINRA Rule 5270, no orders to buy or sell can be made by a firm
> that has material, nonpublic market information, however received,
> about an imminent block trade in a secu- rity or a related security.
> To do so is the prohibited practice of **front-running**.
>
> A **block trade** is generally described as a transaction of a large
> quantity of stock or involving a large dollar amount. In general, an
> order of 10,000 shares or more is considered a block.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Mega Corp instructs its broker-dealer to buy 23,000 shares of Acme,
> Inc., stock. This is a block trade because the transaction involves
> more than 10,000 shares.
>
> Before the trade is executed and reported (i.e., the trade information
> is made publicly available), no one at the broker-dealer that has
> knowledge of the trade can transact in Acme stock prior to executing
> the block.
>
> The regulatory concern is that a registered representative of the firm
> with knowledge of the impending transaction might first place a small
> order in that security for their own account with the expectation that
> this large customer order will drive the price of the security higher.
>

######### [Trading Ahead of Customer Orders]{.underline} 

> FINRA Rule 5320 prohibits a firm from placing its own trading interest
> ahead of a client's. Specifically, a firm is prohibited from trading
> for its own account at a price that is equal to or better than an
> unexecuted customer limit order in that security, unless the firm
> immediately (i.e., within 60 seconds) thereafter executes the customer
> limit order at the same or better price for at least the same number
> of shares.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Broker-Dealer ABC is holding a customer's order to buy 5,000 shares of
> XYZ stock at
>
> \$37. The customer's order has not been executed yet because there
> have been no shares available at \$37 or better. If Broker-Dealer ABC
> purchases 2,000 shares of XYZ for its own inventory at \$37, it must
> immediately thereafter fill the customer's order for 2,000 shares at
> \$37 or better. The effect of these two transactions is that the
> customer gets the 2,000 available shares.
>
> There are exceptions to this prohibition: The rule does not apply if
> the trader was not aware of the customer's order. Additionally, the
> rule does not apply to institutional clients as long as they are given
> written disclosures either at account opening or prior to each trade
> that the firm may trade ahead of their interests.
>
> *Chapter 9*

######## The Secondary Market and Equity Trading {#the-secondary-market-and-equity-trading-18 .unnumbered}

######### [Trading Ahead of Research Reports]{.underline} 

> FINRA Rule 5280 prohibits firms from establishing, increasing, or
> decreasing inventory posi- tions in any security or derivative (i.e.,
> call option) of an issuer ahead of research report publication on that
> company. The purpose of the rule is to prevent the traders at a bro-
> ker-dealer from using and benefiting from nonpublic information in a
> research report before it is available to everyone.
>
> In addition, this rule requires broker-dealers to establish internal
> controls that restrict the flow of information between the research
> department and trading personnel, such as information barriers and
> firewalls. If other people in the firm obtain advance knowledge of
> research reports, they are restricted from communicating with traders
> as well.
>
> This rule focuses on a firm trading from its own inventory---not on
> orders placed for custom- ers. Note that, if the firm receives
> nonpublic advance information from a research report, it must place
> customer orders on an agency basis, not as a principal.

######### [Other Prohibited Forms of Market Manipulation]{.underline} 

> As mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, the '34 Act forbids all
> forms of direct or indi- rect manipulation of securities prices.
>
> The following are examples of expressly prohibited activities relating
> to securities:

-   **Marking the open** or **marking the close** is when a trader
    attempts to manipulate the opening or closing price of a security by
    entering a number of buy or sell orders just prior to the open or
    close of trading. This is especially harmful to the market, as the
    opening and closing prices of a security each trading day have
    special importance---they are widely disseminated and used to
    benchmark market performance.

-   **Spoofing** is a form of market manipulation where a trader enters
    an order to manipulate prices to be higher or lower, with no intent
    of actually executing at the quoted price. In other words, spoofing
    refers to entering orders to entice other

> participants to join on the same side of the market, and then trading
> against other market participants' orders.

-   **Pump and dump** is when an investor attempts to create undue hype
    around the value of their shares by providing exaggerated or
    misleading information, allowing them to sell their position for a
    greater profit. An example is when an investor is randomly solicited
    with positive information over email or social media to purchase
    shares in a penny stock or other risky investment.

-   **Circulation of rumors** is the passing along of false or
    misleading statements concerning a security.

8.  Wilson has heard a hot tip about a company listed on OTC Pink. He
    wants to buy 1,000 shares. What should his broker tell him about
    companies that trade on OTC Pink?

    A.  They are required to file periodic reports with the SEC, so he
        should check out the reports first.

    B.  Stocks are thinly traded, and not much information may be
        available about the companies.

    C.  Very few companies trade on OTC Pink, so there is not much to
        choose from.

    D.  To trade on OTC Pink, companies must meet rigorous listing
        requirements.

1.  (**B**) The ticket includes the type of order, terms and conditions
    of the order, account number, how the order was received, whether or
    not the order was solicited, and the time the order was received.
    The ticket does not capture the client's name but rather identifies
    the client by account number.

2.  (**D**) In a market order, the customer agrees to buy at the ask
    price or sell at the bid price when the order reaches the exchange
    floor for execution. This may be a little different than the price
    the customer sees, or is quoted, when the order is placed.

3.  (**B**) The only type of order that guarantees quick execution is a
    market order.

4.  (**C**) Sell stop orders are entered *below* the current stock price
    to lock in a profit and protect against loss. They will only be
    triggered if the price falls to the stop price. At that point, they
    convert into market orders and are executed at the best available
    price.

5.  (**C**) Remember that buy limit orders are placed below the current
    market and sell limit orders are entered above the current market.
    With stop orders, it is the reverse: buy above; sell below. The
    acronym to remember for orders entered *above* the current market is
    SLoBS. The acronym to remember for orders entered *below* the
    current market is BLiSS.

6.  (**D**) A buy stop order would be used to protect a short stock
    position. If the market value of the short increases above the stop
    price, the order will activate and become a market order, allowing
    Ben to buy back the shares to cover his short.

7.  (**C**) Prices are automatically adjusted (always down) on the
    ex-dividend date, by the amount of a cash dividend, for limit, stop,
    and stop limit orders entered *below* the current market price. This
    will be for buy limit orders and sell stop and stop limit orders.
    *Remember: BLiSS is for divs.* The only way to prevent this
    adjustment in the order is to attach a do not reduce (DNR)
    instruction to the order. The ex-dividend date is one business day
    before the record date.

8.  (**C**) No orders to buy or sell can be made by a firm that has
    material, nonpublic information, however received, about an imminent
    block trade in a security. This violation is called front-running. A
    block trade involves an order of 10,000 shares or more.

9.  (**A**) Investment firms and reps are not allowed to make untrue
    statements of material facts, or to omit or misrepresent material
    facts.

10. (**D**) As a firm rule, broker-dealers cannot act as both a broker
    and dealer in the same transaction. If a firm is a broker, it cannot
    also be a principal in the trade, marking the price up or down. If
    it is a dealer, trading against a customer, it cannot be matching
    parties in a trade as a broker and charging a commission.

11. (**B**) FINRA's 5% policy is a non-binding guideline for fair
    pricing of mark-ups/mark-downs and commissions by broker-dealers. In
    most cases, the firm should not charge more than 5%. However, risky
    trades, illiquid securities, and hard-to-fill orders can be
    considered exceptions.

12. (**A**) The anti-fraud provisions of the '34 Act define and prohibit
    manipulative and deceptive devices.

13. (**B**) There is one case in which a broker-dealer can charge two
    commissions on a single trade: when it is matching two customers
    (the buyer and seller) in an agency trade. Both clients pay a
    commission and both are entitled to best execution.

14. (**D**) On the NYSE, DMMs, previously known as specialists, are
    assigned to ensure orderly and liquid trading in a given stock. One
    DMM is assigned per stock. On Nasdaq, there are no DMMs. Instead,
    several market makers may provide continuous, two-sided firm quotes
    on any given security.

15. (**C**) Market makers can quote different sizes for buying and
    selling, and they usually do. But at minimum, they must offer a
    continuous, two-sided quote (bid and ask) in a size of at least one
    round lot, 100 shares.

16. (**B**) OTC Pink is an electronic quote system for small, obscure,
    and thinly traded OTC companies. It is generally where companies
    that cannot meet exchange requirements trade. OTC Pink companies are
    not required to meet listing requirements or file periodic reports
    or audited financial statements with the SEC.

### Economics and Monetary Policy

> The **economy** encompasses everything related to the production and
> consumption of goods and services in an area, country, or other
> geographic segment. Financial markets, which are greatly influenced by
> forces that affect the economy, play a key role in any economy. This
> chapter will discuss how these forces interact and their impact on
> financial markets and products.

####### Chapter Goals {#chapter-goals-9 .unnumbered}

-   Understand inflation and its impact on interest rates.

-   List the four phases of the business cycle.

-   Distinguish between the different types of yield spreads.

-   Compare and contrast monetary policy and fiscal policy.

-   Describe the tools of the Fed and explain how they are used to
    either ease or tighten the money supply.

-   Distinguish between debit and credit items as they relate to a
    country's balance of trade.

####### Key Terms {#key-terms-9 .unnumbered}

-   **Inflation**---The increasing price of goods and services over
    time, which is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)

-   **Yield curve**---A chart that graphs the relationship between
    interest rates and time until maturity, with a normal yield curve
    illustrating that longer-term bonds have higher rates to compensate
    investors for the greater risk of inflation

-   **Fiscal policy**---Concerned with the use of government spending
    and taxation to influence interest rates and the economy

-   **Monetary policy**---Concerned with the amount of money in
    circulation, which is set by the Federal Reserve Board, to help
    control inflation, interest rates, and overall economic growth

-   **Federal Reserve Board (the Fed)**---The central bank in the US,
    which is responsible for determining the amount of money in
    circulation in order to influence economic growth, inflation,
    unemployment, and exchange rates

> *Chapter 10* Economics and Monetary Policy

-   **Federal funds rate**---The rate that banks charge one another for
    overnight loans, considered the most volatile interest rate in the
    market

-   **Discount rate**---The rate the Fed charges banks for short term
    loans, another tool of the Fed

-   **Open market transactions**---The buying and selling of government
    securities with primary dealers, the primary tool of the Fed

-   **Reserve requirement**---A tool of the Fed that requires banks to
    keep a certain percentage of customer deposits on hand and not lent
    out to customers

-   **Ease money supply**---When the Fed increases the money supply to
    lower interest rates

-   **Tighten money supply**---When the Fed decreases the money supply
    to increase interest rates

###### Factors That Influence and Indicate Economic Performance

> Many complicated and interrelated factors drive the performance of the
> economy, including:

-   Supply and demand

-   Business cycles

-   Increases or decreases in the money supply, and

-   Industry-specific earnings and output

######### [Consumer Spending]{.underline} 

> The personal expenditures of US consumers along with their attitudes
> about spending have a powerful ability to cause fluctuations in the
> economy. If consumers have a negative attitude about the economy, they
> are reluctant to spend. On the other hand, when sentiments are
> positive, consumers tend to spend more and invest with confidence.
> This behavior increases the health of the economy and income levels.
>
> Several factors impact consumer spending, described below.
>
> ***[10.1.1.1 Interest Rates]{.underline}***
>
> **Interest rates** are the cost of capital. They are subject to the
> laws of supply and demand. The rate of interest is considered the
> price of credit, so it greatly influences investments.
>
> Spenders and savers view interest rates differently. High interest
> rates mean high costs of credit, so they deter capital investment and
> spending, but they are attractive to savers. Low interest rates can
> stimulate capital investment, but they are unattractive to savers.
>
> ***[10.1.1.2 Rate of Inflation]{.underline}***
>
> In economics, **inflation** is a rise in the general level of the
> prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When
> the price level rises, currency buys fewer goods and services;
> consequently, inflation erodes the purchasing power of money.
>
> In the US, inflation is measured by the **Consumer Price Index**, or
> **CPI**, which is calculated by the Department of Labor and measures
> the rate of increase or decrease in consumer goods and services.
>
> *Chapter 10* Economics and Monetary Policy
>
> Inflation can be viewed as having a positive or negative effect on the
> economy. Most econo- mists believe that moderate inflation levels are
> needed to drive consumption and promote spending, which are crucial
> for economic growth. The Federal Reserve targets an annual, controlled
> rate of inflation for the US economy.
>
> Negative effects of inflation include a decrease in the value of
> money. Uncertainty about future inflation may discourage investment
> and saving, and high inflation may lead to shortages of goods if
> consumers begin hoarding out of concern for future price increases.
> Economists generally agree that high rates of inflation are caused by
> an excessive growth of the money supply.

3.  ***Unemployment***

> Unemployment is usually measured by the **unemployment rate**, which
> is defined as the percentage of those in the labor force who are
> without work. The unemployment rate is considered an important
> measurement of economic performance. Economic theory posits that a
> certain level of unemployment is inevitable, a necessary evil to
> prevent inflation. Although the causes of unemployment are disputed,
> theoretically it occurs from insufficient demand for goods and
> services in the economy, or structural problems and inefficiencies in
> labor markets, such as mismatches between the supply of and demand for
> workers with a particular skill set.
>
> High unemployment is considered a negative economic factor, and
> usually accompanies economic downturns.

4.  ***Elasticity***

> **Elasticity** refers to the sensitivity of supply and demand of a
> commodity to a change of price. If a commodity is demand elastic, that
> means that as prices change, demand will change. For example, if
> prices increase, demand will decrease, and vice versa. Alternatively,
> if a commod- ity is demand inelastic, a change in price will have no
> impact on demand for that product.
>
> *Chapter 10* Economics and Monetary Policy

######### [Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Product (GNP)]{.underline} 

> **Gross domestic product (GDP)** is defined as the total market value
> of goods and services produced within a country, regardless of the
> nationality of those who produce them. **Gross national product
> (GNP)** is the total market value of goods and services produced by
> the residents of a country, even if they're living abroad. For
> example, if a US resident earns money from an overseas investment, the
> value is included in GNP, but not GDP. However, goods produced by
> foreign-owned business within the US are included in GDP, but not GNP.
>
> GDP is the primary metric used for measuring US economic growth and
> analyzing economic performance. Growth of the US economy is determined
> by comparing the change in GDP from one year to the next.

######### [The Business Cycle]{.underline} 

> The terms **business cycle** and **economic cycle** refer to a
> recurring pattern and fluctuation in economic activity ranging over
> several months to a number of years. A business cycle's magnitude and
> length is not regular or predictable; instead its timing is random and
> its level of severity is unpredictable.
>
> The business cycle is a sequence of four phases, as shown in the
> following diagram: **expan- sion**, **peak**, **contraction**, and
> **trough**.
>
> ![](media/image17.png)Peak

Expansion

> Contraction
>
> Trough
>
> **Expansion** is characterized by increased economic activity and
> increased availability of goods and services in the marketplace.
> Unemployment declines in a period of expansion, and there is a
> measurable rise in GDP.
>
> A risk of an economy that grows too quickly is **inflation**, or
> increasing prices and cost of living.
>
> At times, periods of slow economic growth may be accompanied by rising
> prices, or inflation and relatively high unemployment. This condition,
> **stagflation**, is thought to be caused by sharp increases in
> essential commodities, like oil, or poor economic policy.
>
> A **peak** occurs when an expansion reaches its highest point and
> marks the beginning of an economic downturn. It is the point at which
> an expansion turns into a contraction.
>
> **Contractions** are characterized by a slowdown in the pace of
> economic activity. Production, as measured by GDP, employment,
> investment spending, manufacturing output, household incomes, and
> business profits, may fall during contractions, potentially resulting
> in corpo- rate bankruptcies and high unemployment.
>
> A **trough** occurs when a contraction reaches its lowest point and
> begins to turn. It is the point at which the contraction turns into an
> expansion.
>
> ***[10.1.3.1 Recession and Depression]{.underline}***
>
> A **recession** is a prolonged period of contraction. By definition, a
> recession occurs after a decline in GDP for two or more consecutive
> quarters.
>
> A **depression** is a sustained, long-term downturn in economic
> activity in one or more eco- nomic sectors. More severe than a
> recession, it is characterized by a decline in real GDP exceeding 10%,
> or at least six consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.

######### [Economic Indicators]{.underline} 

> **Economic indicators** are measures that help assess the health of

>
> These indicators have been categorized into three groups that identify
> whether they change before, during, or after a change in the business
> cycle.
>
> *Chapter 10* Economics and Monetary Policy

1.  ***Leading Indicators***

> **Leading indicators** are those that change before the economy starts
> to follow a particular pattern or trend. Leading economic indicators
> include:

-   Bond yields

-   Building permits (new private housing)

-   Manufacturing activity

-   Stock market indices and averages (e.g., S&P 500)

-   Producer Price Index

-   Layoff rates

-   Average of weekly unemployment insurance claims, and

-   Changes in business inventories

    1.  ***Lagging Indicators***

> **Lagging indicators** change after the economy has already begun to
> follow a particular pattern or trend. Examples of lagging indicators
> include:

-   Interest rates, particularly the **prime rate**

-   Unemployment rate

-   Corporate profits

-   Balance of trade

-   Inventory/sales ratio

-   Labor cost per unit of output, and

-   Commercial and industrial loans outstanding

    1.  ***Coincident Indicators***

> **Coincident indicators** are economic factors that vary
> simultaneously with the business cycle. Examples of coincident
> indicators are:

-   GDP

-   Industrial Production Index and Capacity Utilization Index

-   Employees on non-agricultural payrolls (i.e., non-farm payrolls)

-   Personal income

-   Consumer spending, and

-   Retail and manufacturing sales

###### Financial Markets and the Economy

> A fundamental knowledge of economics is important to understanding how
> financial instru- ments perform in different market environments.
> Markets overall are categorized as:

-   **Bull market**---A market that experiences an extended rise in the
    price of stocks, bonds, and commodities. Usually lasting for several
    months, it draws investors into the action, causing trading volume
    to rise, as investors are confident that strong results will
    continue.

-   **Bear market**---A prolonged period of declining prices, this type
    of market may be caused by a fear of a slowdown in the economy.
    During this time, selling increases, as there is widespread
    pessimism that losses will continue.

######### [Bond Markets and the Economy]{.underline} 

> Fixed-income instruments, including bonds, are closely linked to
> economic performance because of their relationship to interest rates.
>
> Because rising interest rates cause a decline in bond prices, the bond
> market tends to react negatively to reports of strong and potentially
> inflationary levels of economic growth. Negative economic news may
> indicate lower inflation and interest rate cuts, which is generally
> positive for bond prices.
>
> In times of significant market downturns, investors often sell out of
> equity investment and bonds of lower credit quality to purchase safer
> instruments, like Treasury bills. This investor behavior is known as a
> **flight to quality** and can lead to an increase in the price of
> certain Treasury issues for a period of time.

######### [Yield Curve]{.underline} 

> A **yield curve** is a graph that plots the relationship between
> interest rates and the time to maturity. The shape of the yield curve
> is closely scrutinized because it gives an idea of future interest
> rate expectations and predicts changes in economic output and growth.
>
> The most frequently reported yield curve compares the three-month,
> two-year, five-year, 10-year, and 30-year US Treasury debt. This yield
> curve is used as a benchmark for other debt in the market, such as
> mortgage rates or bank lending rates.
>
> There are three main types of yield curve shapes: **normal**,
> **inverted**, and **flat** (or humped). A **normal yield curve** is
> pictured below. In this diagram, longer maturity bonds have a higher
> yield compared to shorter-term bonds due to the risks associated with
> holding a bond for a longer period of time. This is the most common
> yield curve shape.
>
> ***Normal Yield Curve***
>
> Yield
>
> Time to Maturity
>
> An **inverted yield curve** reflects shorter-term yields that are
> higher than longer-term yields, which can be a sign of an upcoming
> recession.
>
> ***Inverted Yield Curve***
>
> Yield
>
> Time to Maturity
>
> A **flat** (or humped) **yield curve** is one in which shorter- and
> longer-term yields are very close to each other, which is a predictor
> of an economic transition.
>
> ***Flat (Humped) Yield Curve***
>
> *Chapter 10* Economics and Monetary Policy
>
> Yield
>
> Time to Maturity
>
> The slope of the yield curve is also seen as an indication of interest
> rate behavior: the greater the slope, the greater the gap between
> short- and long-term rates.

######### Yield Spreads

> The term **yield spread** refers to the difference in the quoted rates
> of return between two bonds or two types of bonds. It is used to
> compare the difference in yields of bonds with differing maturities,
> credit rating, liquidity, and risk.
>
> In simple terms, the yield spread is an indication of the risk
> premium---or increased return--- for investing in one bond over
> another, or against a common benchmark. It is a key metric that bond
> investors use to analyze the cost of a particular investment. For
> example, if one bond yields 5% and another yields 4%, the spread is 1%
> or 100 basis points.
>
> When computing the yield spread, the yield of non-Treasury bonds is
> generally compared to the yield of US Treasury bonds of comparable
> maturity. The higher the risk of a bond, the higher its yield spread.
> This yield spread difference is the payment to investors to take on
> additional risk.
>
> Investors usually don't require much incentive to invest in low-risk
> investments. For exam- ple, a bond issued by a large, well-known, and
> financially strong corporation will typically trade at a relatively
> low spread in relation to US Treasury bonds. Conversely, a bond issued
> by a smaller corporation with weaker financial strength will trade at
> a higher spread relative to Treasuries.

######### Yield Spreads and Credit Quality

> When **spreads widen** between bonds with different quality ratings,
> the market is assumed to be forecasting more risk of default on
> lower-grade bonds.
>
> For example, if a 10-year Treasury note is currently yielding 4% while
> 10-year, non-in- vestment-grade bonds are averaging 6%, the spread
> between Treasuries and non-invest- ment-grade bonds is 2%. If that
> spread widens to 4%, the market is forecasting a greater risk of
> default, which implies a slowing economy.
>
> When **spreads narrow** between bonds of different quality ratings,
> the market is forecasting less risk, possibly due to a growing economy
> and increasing consumer confidence.
>
> Usually, yield spreads increase during periods of recession and
> decrease during periods of expansion. The strengthening economy and
> increasing consumer confidence inspire greater comfort with
> lower-rated issues.

######### Equity Markets and the Economy

> The performance of the stock market is also closely tied to economic
> factors. Strong business performance, increased consumer confidence,
> and a stable political environment all have a positive impact. Other
> factors that drive positive stock market performance include:

-   A reduction in interest rates

-   Strong employment

-   Moderate inflation, and

-   Increases in GDP

> Individual stock performance is tied to the stock market in general,
> but it is also directly related to the performance of the issuing
> company. Good earnings or corporate expansion can cause a stock's
> price to go up. Poor sales and profits can cause a stock's price to
> drop.
>
> Stock market performance can have a profound impact on the economy and
> public morale. A collapse in share prices can cause a widespread
> economic panic and plummeting investor confidence, while the reverse
> is also true. Strong market performance makes people feel wealthier,
> more confident, and more willing to take some financial risk.
>
> If inflation is high, interest rates usually increase. Under these
> circumstances, investors may choose bond investments over stocks
> because bond issuers must pay higher rates to investors. This decrease
> in demand may weaken stock market performance overall.
>
> ***[10.2.5.1 Cyclical and Defensive Stocks]{.underline}***
>
> Stocks can be categorized by how they are affected by the performance
> of the economy. **Cyclical stocks** mirror the economy, strengthening
> when the economy is growing and declining as the economy contracts.
> Companies that supply capital equipment for busi- nesses or
> high-ticket consumer items, such as cars and large appliances, are
> cyclical. These stocks can be most profitable when purchased at the
> bottom of a business cycle and sold at a peak, although this kind of
> investment strategy can be very difficult to time.
>
> *Chapter 10* Economics and Monetary Policy
>
> **Defensive stocks** are resistant to changes in economic cycles. Even
> when most consumers and businesses cut back spending, these companies
> continue to profit because they supply a basic need, offer a way to
> cut costs, or have the lowest prices. Examples of defensive stocks

######### Interest-Rate-Sensitive Stocks {#interest-rate-sensitive-stocks .unnumbered}

> Certain stocks are held by investors for their stable stream of
> dividend payments. Because these stocks function like fixed-income
> investments, their prices are more susceptible to interest rate
> changes than those of other stocks. Utility stocks, real estate
> stocks, preferred stock shares, and REITs are examples of equity
> investments that are highly sensitive to inter- est rate changes.
>
> Other factors, such as the industry in which a company operates,
> contribute to a stock's sensitivity to interest rate changes. For
> example, home builders will experience decreasing share prices when
> interest rates rise above a tolerable level, as fewer individuals are
> likely to purchase homes, due to the increasing cost of mortgages.
> Companies with large amounts

> ***10.2.5.2 Investment Performance and Inflation***
>
> The impact of inflation varies by type of asset:
>
> **Cash**---Inflation causes rising interest rates; therefore, savers
> tend to earn a higher return when inflation is higher. However, as
> inflation increases, the purchasing power of cash will decrease,
> leading to inflationary risk.
>
> **Bonds**---Inflation erodes the purchasing power of bonds' fixed
> interest payments. Inflation also usually leads to higher interest
> rates. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Consequently, a
> bond's market value is less when inflation is higher.
>
> **Stocks**---Moderate inflation can increase asset values, but as it
> reaches high and unpredict- able levels this might create higher costs
> for a business and hurt corporate profits.
>
> **Real estate**---Higher cash flows and asset values tend to result in
> a positive relationship between real estate and inflation.

######### [Company Financial Statements]{.underline} 

> The economic environment will also impact the business prospects of
> each individual company. In order to examine the core numbers of a
> specific business and understand its financial health, one can review
> that company's financial statements, such as its income statement and
> balance sheet.
>
> ***10.2.6.1 Income Statement***
>
> The **income statement**, sometimes referred to as a **profit and loss
> statement**, reports a company's revenues, expenses, and net income
> over a period of time. These results indicate the profits of a company
> and might be measured over a quarter or a full year. A few key
> components of the income statement are outlined below:

-   **Revenue**, or **sales**, represents the total dollar amount
    > realized by a company through the sale of its products or services
    > during a given time period.

-   **Expenses** provides insight into the costs incurred to generate
    > those sales. This includes variable costs, which are the direct
    > costs associated with producing any goods that generate sales,
    > such as raw materials, labor, and other manufacturing inputs.
    > Additionally, it includes fixed costs of running the business,
    > such as administrative expenses, marketing, and rent.

-   **Net income** reflects the profits earned or lost during the period
    > after taking into account the variable and fixed expenses listed
    > above, as well as any items that might eat into company profits,
    > such as taxes and interest expenses that might have to be paid to
    > bondholders. This is a company's bottom line profit after every
    > type of

> expense has been paid. Any dividends that a company pays to
> shareholders come out of its net income. The portion of net income
> that is not paid to shareholders is referred to as **retained
> earnings** and represents a reinvestment into the company to grow the
> business.
>
> Earnings per share (EPS) is a metric that is used to gauge how
> profitable a company is on a per-share basis. EPS is calculated by
> taking a company's net income and dividing by total shares
> outstanding.
>
> *Chapter 10* Economics and Monetary Policy
>
> The price/earnings to growth (**PEG**) ratio is another metric that is
> used by investors to mea- sure a stock's value. The PEG ratio uses the
> price/earnings (**P/E**) ratio while also factoring in a company's
> expected growth. While the P/E ratio values a company based on current
> share price to EPS, the PEG ratio is often considered to provide a
> more enhanced metric by factoring in a company's expected growth rate.
>
> ***[10.2.6.2 Balance Sheet]{.underline}***
>
> Unlike the income statement, which measures company performance over a
> quarter or year, the **balance sheet** is a snapshot of the company's
> assets and liabilities, taken at a moment in time. This moment is
> usually on the last day of a quarter or year. This financial statement
> is referred to as a balance sheet because, if the accounting is done
> properly, the balance sheet equation (as shown below) will always hold
> true.
>
> **Balance Sheet Equation:**
>
> **Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity**
>
> or
>
> **Assets** â **Liabilities = Shareholders' Equity**
>
> As seen in the equation above, the three main components of the
> balance sheet are:

-   **Assets** reflects everything a company owns. Examples include the
    cash it has in the bank, its securities portfolio, its inventory of
    product, and the property (e.g., factories or real estate) it owns.

> *Chapter 10* Economics and Monetary Policy

-   **Liabilities** reflects everything owed by the company. Examples
    include outstanding debt obligations, the cash owed to vendors and
    suppliers, and taxes owed to the IRS.

-   **Shareholder's equity**, also referred to as **net worth**,
    reflects the difference between the company's assets and
    liabilities. Because it measures how much the company owns versus
    owes, it is an important metric in determining its financial health.

######### Working Capital {#working-capital .unnumbered}

> **Working capital** is a metric that helps to measure how much cash a
> company needs to finance its current operations. It can be calculated
> from a company's balance sheet as cur- rent assets minus current
> liabilities.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Company XYZ has total assets of \$10 million, current assets of \$3
> million, total liabilities of \$6 million, and current liabilities of
> \$1.5 million. XYZ's working capital would be \$1.5 million (current
> assets of \$3 million minus current liabilities of \$1.5 million).

#### Progress Check---Solutions {#progress-checksolutions-9 .unnumbered}

1.  (**C**) Economic cycles can be measured from peak to peak or from
    trough to trough. A peak is the highest point in a given expansion
    and marks the beginning of an economic downturn.

2.  (**C**) A recession occurs when gross domestic product declines for
    two or more consecutive quarters.

3.  (**A**) Leading indicators, such as bond yields and manufacturing
    activity, tend to change *before* the economy starts to follow a
    particular trend, giving the first signs of any turn in an economic
    cycle.

4.  (**B**) Unemployment rate is a lagging indicator because it does not
    tend to turn or accelerate in any direction until economic-cycle
    trends are already underway, perhaps by three

> to six months. It takes time for a change in the cycle to impact it.

5.  (**D**) Bear markets are not necessarily a good omen for bonds. If
    the Fed is tightening and rates are rising, bond prices can fall. If
    the economy is slowing, bond defaults can rise and credit ratings
    can fall. However, bonds may still do well because investors become
    more risk-averse and flee stocks for bonds. This is called a flight
    to quality.

6.  (**B**) Yield curves plot bond yields (Y axis) against bond
    maturities (X axis). Logically, investors require higher interest
    rates to invest in longer-term bonds. This is reflected in a normal
    yield curve. An unusual situation exists when short-term yields are
    higher than long-term---i.e., an inverted yield curve. It may mean
    investors are anticipating negative near-term credit events that
    will cause defaults or stress in shorter maturities. Or it can mean
    investors expect the Fed to start reducing short-term interest
    rates.

7.  (**B**) Yield spreads measure the extra yield (interest rate)
    investors demand to hold lower- quality bonds versus US Treasuries
    or other very-high-quality bonds. Thus, yield spreads measure
    investors' appetite to seek higher yield in return for lower
    quality, or conversely to emphasize quality and safety. If spreads
    are widening, it means investors are emphasizing quality, perhaps
    because the economy is weakening.

8.  (**D**) Shareholder equity is the net worth of a company, calculated
    as assets minus liabilities. If the company were liquidated with all
    debts paid, it is the value that would be returned to shareholders.

###### The Federal Reserve and Economic Policy

> **Economic policy** refers to government intervention to impact
> economic performance. It is used either to stimulate an economy out of
> recession or to constrain excessive growth and prevent inflation.

######### [Economic Theories]{.underline} 

> The science of economics helps explain the movement of goods in a
> market and incorpo- rates the study of factors such as government
> spending, tax collections, money supply, and consumer spending data to
> propose regulation and establish policy.
>
> ***[10.3.1.1 Classical Economics]{.underline}***
>
> Adam Smith, a Scotsman who lived from 1723 to 1790, is considered the
> founder of modern economics. His groundbreaking book *The Wealth of
> Nations* was published in 1776. After studying the interactions of
> society and necessary goods and services, Smith concluded that
> individuals in society manage to produce and purchase the goods and
> services they need without the intervention of the government. Smith
> called this concept of self-regulation "the invisible hand."
>
> Stated another way, Adam Smith believed in a free market economy that
> would achieve full employment through the forces of supply and demand.
> His followers, the **classical econ- omists**, recommended the use of
> neither monetary nor fiscal policy by the government, believing that
> the market functions best without government interference. This
> hands-off policy is known as **laissez-faire economics**.

> ***[10.3.1.2 Keynesian Economics]{.underline}***
>
> **Keynesian economics** was born during the Great Depression of the
> 1930s, after the US expe- rienced unemployment of more than 25%. The
> experience of the Great Depression showed that market forces without
> intervention did not work as well as the classical economists had
> believed. John Maynard Keynes, an Englishman, believed that classical
> economics suffered from major flaws. Keynes argued for the need for
> government intervention to stabilize aggre- gate demand when it falls
> short of the demand level needed to generate full employment.
>
> The early Keynesian economists recommended that the government should
> use **fiscal pol- icy** (including both government spending and taxes)
> to make up for the shortfall in private aggregate demand and to create
> jobs in the private sector. Keynesian economics propose higher
> spending and lower taxes to stimulate the economy.
>
> Modern Keynesians recommend **monetary policy**, in addition to fiscal
> policy, to manage the level of aggregate demand. For example, during
> the 2008 recession, a major spending package was passed by Congress in
> addition to aggressive efforts by the Fed to make credit available.

3.  ***Monetarism***

> Popularized by Milton Friedman, **monetarism** is an economic school

######### Monetary Policy

> **Monetary policy** is concerned with the amount of money in

>
> A central bank is a banking institution that functions to control a
> nation's money supply. It is empowered to create the currency of that
> nation and control lending rates and interest rates as well as to loan
> money to other banks in times of need or financial crises. Central
> banks, like the Fed, often have oversight over other banks in the
> banking system.
>
> The Fed uses a variety of tools to influence economic growth,

-   Open market operations

-   Discount rate

-   Reserve and margin requirements

> Fighting inflation is one of the Fed's most important mandates. The
> Fed closely monitors changes in price levels through the CPI to keep

>
> A growing economy is characterized by an increase in consumer

> up. These periods of economic growth, and the accompanying increased
> demand for money, place upward pressure on interest rates.
>
> A reduced demand for borrowing is consistent with decreasing economic
> activity. This lack of demand during economic downturns causes the Fed
> to push interest rates downward. Lower interest rates encourage
> economic activity by making consumer spending as well as business
> investment and financing cheaper. The monetary policy it exercises is
> designed to increase the money supply. This policy ultimately causes
> inflation to rise because it puts more money in the hands of
> consumers.
>
> *Chapter 10* Economics and Monetary Policy

> Today, most economists favor a low and steady rate of inflation. Low
> inflation helps reduce the severity of economic recessions by enabling

>
> The primary tool of monetary policy is **open market operations**. The
> arm of the Federal Reserve Board that deals in open market operations

>
> When the **Fed sells** securities, primary dealers are forced to

> rise. This is referred to as **tightening the money supply**. It is
> executed by the Fed to curb inflation or prevent the economy from
> overheating.
>
> When the **Fed purchases** securities, primary dealers must sell
> securities, receiving cash, which increases the money supply, driving
> down interest rates. This is referred to as **easing or loosening the
> money supply**. Its goal is to increase lending, spurring the economy,
> or bringing the economy out of a recession.

######### Federal Funds Rate {#federal-funds-rate .unnumbered}

> Banks also lend funds to each other on an overnight basis. The
> interest rate charged between banks is known as the **federal funds
> rate**. Changes to the federal funds rate are heavily influenced by
> the open market operations of the Federal Reserve Board, though the
> rate is actually determined by supply and demand in the market. It is
> not set by the Fed.
>
> Many other interest rates will change based on the fed funds rate. For
> example, the prime rate at which banks charge customers for loans will
> increase when the fed funds rate increases.

>
> The portion of deposits that banks are not permitted to lend, and must
> keep either on hand or on deposit at a Federal Reserve Bank, is called
> their **reserve requirement**. For example, if the reserve requirement
> is 10% of transaction deposits, a bank that receives a \$100 deposit
> may lend out \$90 of that deposit. As that \$90 travels through the
> financial system and is deposited, it creates new money when it is
> subsequently loaned, and the cycle continues. An *increase* in the
> reserve requirement tightens the money supply, as banks are required
> to keep more money on deposit; a *reduction* in the reserve
> requirement is an expansionary strategy, as banks are required to keep
> fewer funds on deposit, allowing for more loans.

###### International Economic Factors

> International trade represents a significant share of the US GDP. A
> product or service that is sold to a trading partner in another
> country is an **export**, while a product that is bought from a
> trading partner in another country is an **import**.

######### [Balance of Trade]{.underline} 

> **Balance of trade** is the difference between a country's exports and
> imports. **Debit items** include imported goods, foreign aid, domestic
> spending abroad, and domestic investments abroad. **Credit items**
> include exported goods, foreign spending in the domestic economy, and
> foreign investments in the domestic economy.
>
> A country has a **trade deficit** if it has a larger debit balance
> with more imports than exports, and a **trade surplus**, or a larger
> credit balance, if it exports more than it imports.
>
> In a recession, countries try to export more, with the intent of
> creating new jobs and increasing demand. In a strong expansion,
> countries prefer to import more, providing
>
> *Chapter 10* Economics and Monetary Policy
>
> price competition. This helps limit inflation and, without increasing
> prices, provides goods beyond the economy's ability to meet supply. A
> trade deficit is not helpful during a recession, but it may boost
> economic performance during an expansion.
>
> Historically, the United States has been among the largest importers
> due to dependency on energy imports (e.g., oil) and demand for
> consumer products. Therefore, the US has had a trade deficit every
> year since the mid '70s. Conversely, China produces and exports some
> of the world's most popular consumer goods, and therefore almost
> always has a trade surplus.

######### [Exchange Rates]{.underline} 

> An **exchange rate** specifies how much one currency is worth in terms
> of another. It is the value of a foreign nation's currency in terms of
> the home nation's currency. For example, if the exchange rate of the
> Canadian dollar is quoted at 1.07, it takes 1.07 Canadian dollars to
> purchase one US dollar.
>
> Changes in currency exchange rates can have a huge impact on both
> business profits and securities prices. When the US dollar *weakens*
> against another currency, that currency is worth more dollars. In this
> case, foreign investment in the US dollar will decline. Imports will
> also decline, as they will be more expensive to US businesses and
> consumers. On the other hand, a weaker dollar makes importing US goods
> more attractive to foreign countries. Therefore, exports will
> increase.
>
> When the US dollar *strengthens* against another currency, the dollar
> buys more of that cur- rency. Foreign investment will increase, as
> foreign investors will be attracted to a strong US dollar. US imports
> will increase, as it will be cheaper for US businesses and consumers
> to purchase foreign goods. Finally, US exports will decrease, as US
> goods will be expensive for consumers in many foreign countries.
>
> In moderate inflationary periods:

-   The US dollar will typically strengthen.

-   Interest rates and bond yields will likely move upwards, driving
    bond prices down.

-   While high inflation can be negative for a currency, a certain
    amount of inflation is healthy for an expanding economy.

######### [Interaction of Foreign and Domestic Interest Rates]{.underline} 

> The US economy and the world economy are interdependent in many ways.
> Economic developments in this country have a major influence on
> economic stability, production, employment, and prices beyond our
> borders; developments abroad also affect our economy significantly.
> Because of this linkage, the Fed participates directly in
> international economic affairs.
>
> The dollar's exchange value in terms of other currencies is influenced
> by the Fed's monetary policy. The Fed engages in the purchase and sale
> of foreign currency to counter disorderly conditions in exchange
> markets. For example, during episodes of downward pressure on the
> dollar, the Federal Reserve has purchased dollars (sold foreign
> currency) to support the price. Similarly, the Federal Reserve may

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-9 .unnumbered}

1.  (**C**) After the Great Depression of the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes
    argued for more government intervention to stabilize aggregate
    demand when it falls short of levels needed for full employment.
    Modern Keynesian economists believe the economy should be heavily
    influenced by active government involvement.

2.  (**A**) Working capital is calculated as current assets minus
    current liabilities.

3.  (**C**) Classical economists believe economies are governed by
    natural self-correcting laws and should be left to free-market
    forces. They argue for no government intervention.

4.  (**B**) By raising interest rates, the Fed discourages borrowing,
    which can help put the brakes on an overheating economy. Also, the
    Fed could sell government securities in the open market, which would
    have the impact of withdrawing cash from the economy.

5.  (**C**) The Fed's open market operations are designed to inject cash
    into the economy or remove cash from the economy. The operations are
    carried out by trading securities with primary dealers, large
    financial institutions. To stimulate the economy, the Fed buys
    securities from the dealers, which has the effect of pumping cash
    into the economy.

6.  (**B**) Fed actions to stimulate economic growth are said to be
    loosening the money supply. Fed actions to dampen economic growth
    and control inflation are said to be tightening the money supply.

7.  (**C**) In addition to the discount rate and open market operations,
    a third monetary policy tool the Fed can use is to change bank
    reserve requirements---the portion of deposits that banks are not
    permitted to lend. A higher reserve requirement is consistent with a
    tightening monetary policy. A lower reserve requirement is
    consistent with a loosening policy.

8.  (**D**) Balance of trade measures the difference between the value
    of a country's exports and its imports. A trade deficit means the
    value of imports exceeds exports---money is flowing out of the
    country.

9.  (**D**) When financial headlines discuss gross domestic product
    (GDP), they are usually referencing the change in real GDP year over
    year---i.e., economic growth adjusted for inflation.

10. (**C**) Economic cycles have four phases. In order, they are
    expansion, peak, contraction (recession), trough. An expansion ends
    with a peak, and a recession ends with a trough. Stagflation is a
    term that describes a period of slow economic growth combined with
    high or rising inflation.

11. (**A**) During strong economic times, inflation will start to
    increase so the Federal Reserve will likely raise rates to help curb
    inflation.

12. (**A**) The stock market is considered an important leading
    indicator of economic activity and cycles.

13. (**B**) An inverted yield curve has often been an accurate way to
    predict a weakening economy and a recession ahead. An inverted yield
    curve (lower long-term yields than short-term yields) means
    investors are preferring to pile into long-term securities, rather
    than hold short-term maturities. They do this mainly because they
    believe the Fed is about to start a cycle of interest rate cuts,
    which will benefit long-term bonds the most.

14. (**B**) During recessions, defensive stocks hold value better than
    the stock market as a whole. This can be due in part to
    substitution---the tendency of households to buy lower- priced goods
    during tough times. Discount retailers and grocers also sell large
    quantities of consumer staples---items people need and use all the
    time, even during recessions. Toothpaste is an example.

15. (**A**) Because utility companies typically pay a stable stream of
    dividend payments, they are more susceptible to interest rate
    changes than other stocks.

16. (**B**) Shareholder's equity is shown on a company's balance sheet
    as assets minus liabilities. It is the bottom line of the balance
    sheet, while income is recorded as the bottom line of the income
    statement.

###### Opening New Accounts

> Registered representatives of a broker-dealer are authorized to open
> new accounts for cus- tomers, subject to a principal's approval. New
> accounts may be opened for single or multiple individuals, business
> entities, institutions, trusts, and investment clubs. This section
> will discuss the regulations relating to firm telemarketing as well as
> the rules and procedures associated with opening a new account.

######### [Telemarketing]{.underline} 

> Firms often solicit new business by cold-calling or faxing potential
> clients. MSRB Rule G-39 and FINRA Rule 3230 limit these activities to
> persons who are not current customers of the firm. Persons who are
> making calls on behalf of a firm can do so between the hours of **8:00
> am and 9:00 pm** in the local time of the person being called.
>
> Any scripts used for telemarketing are considered retail
> communications and must be approved by a principal before first use.
>
> The rule also stipulates that the following information must be
> disclosed when a solicitation is made by phone:

-   The name of the caller and the firm with whom the caller is
    associated

-   The telephone number and the address at which the caller can be
    contacted, and

-   The reason for the call (e.g., soliciting new business)

> The **telemarketing rule** also requires a **do-not-call list**.
> Persons who do not wish to receive these solicitations must be added
> to the firm's internal list and cannot be called again for an
> indefinite period of time. Additionally, persons who are registered
> with the Federal Trade Commission's national do-not-call registry
> cannot be contacted.
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts
>
> These rules do not apply to existing customers of the firm or contacts
> made to other firms. Additionally, the rule does not apply if the
> registered representative has a personal relation- ship with the
> individual or has received that person's prior written consent.

> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts

######### [New Account Form]{.underline} 

> If a customer decides to open a new account with a broker-dealer, he
> needs to provide certain information to the registered representative
> of the opening firm. FINRA Rule 4512 requires that the following
> information be documented on each new account application or form:

-   Full legal name

-   Legal US address

-   Telephone number (residence and business)

-   Social Security or Tax Identification number

-   Date of birth

-   Employment status, including occupation of the customer and whether
    the customer is an employee of a broker-dealer

-   Citizenship status

-   Annual income

-   Net worth (excluding the value of primary residence)

-   Tax bracket

-   Investment objectives

-   Investment experience

-   Risk tolerance

> Much of this information, which is necessary to determine the
> suitability of the transactions for the account, must be submitted to
> a designated principal at the broker-dealer for review. The account
> will be accepted or declined by the firm based on this documentation.
>
> A sample **new account form** is shown below, for context:

######### Numbered Accounts {#numbered-accounts .unnumbered}

> Notwithstanding the above, FINRA Rule 3250 allows broker-dealers, at a
> customer's request, to open accounts that are identified only by a
> symbol or number, but not an alias (e.g., John Doe), in order for the
> account holder to remain anonymous. However, the customer must still
> provide a written statement of ownership and proof of identity.
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts

######### The Broker-Dealer Suitability Obligation

> As discussed in a previous chapter, industry regulations require that
> broker-dealers and registered representatives follow the
> know-your-customer rule, meaning they must under- stand the essential
> facts of each client. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that firms
> know all the key facts necessary to make appropriate investment
> recommendations to clients.
>
> Examples of these key facts include:

> This information must be obtained from the customer **before
> execution** of a recommended transaction. If a customer refuses to
> disclose this information, the account can still be opened, but the
> rep cannot make any recommendations.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Susan fills out a new account form to open an account at ABC
> Brokerage. She provides important legal information but declines to
> disclose her net worth and total income. In this case, the account may
> be approved, but the rep managing the account cannot rec- ommend any
> particular securities. Only unsolicited orders (meaning those
> initiated by the customer) can be taken.

######### Account Approval

> The opening of an account must be approved by a designated principal,
> i.e., a supervisor, prior to or promptly after the completion of any
> transaction for the account. This written approval becomes part of the
> permanent account record, and indicates that the account is compliant
> with the firm's policies and procedures.
>
> The customer and the registered representative do not need to sign the
> new account form. It is only signed by the designated principal who
> approves the new account.

######### Verification of Customer Information

> SEC Rule 17a-4 requires firms to ensure that customer account
> information is accurate and up to date. After a new account is opened,
> a firm has 30 days to send the new customer a request for verification
> of the account information. The customer is asked to make any cor-
> rections to the account record and return it to the broker-dealer.
>
> If the customer notifies the firm of a change, the firm must send an
> updated account record for verification within 30 days of receiving
> the customer's notice. On an ongoing basis, this same verification
> must be sent once every 36 months, and in accounts with joint
> ownership, these notices must be sent to each owner.

###### Types of Retail Accounts

> Registered representatives must understand the type of account most
> appropriate for each client and that client's particular needs,
> requirements, and investment objectives.

######### [Cash Accounts]{.underline} 

> In a **cash account**, a customer must pay in full for securities. The
> customer can purchase securities for up to the amount of cash
> deposited. Usually, the account is opened with a cash deposit, and
> trades can be placed as long as the cash is sufficient to cover the
> cost of the securities. The proceeds of any securities sold are
> usually deposited into the account. There is no limit on the amount of
> cash that may be maintained in a cash account, and customers have the
> right to withdraw cash balances held in a cash account at any time, in
> whole or in part.
>
> Trades made in a cash account usually settle T + 2, though most
> brokers require customers to pay for securities purchased prior to
> settlement.
>
> ***[11.2.1.1 Regulation T Settlement and Free-Riding]{.underline}***
>
> Although regular way settlement requires payments on T + 2, Regulation
> T (discussed shortly in more detail) mandates that investors must pay
> for all purchases within four business days of the trade (T + 4).
>
> If the customer has purchased securities and does not pay for them by
> T + 4, the broker-dealer may ask its self-regulatory organization
> (e.g., FINRA) for additional time on behalf of the cus- tomer. If no
> extension is received, the position must be sold out on the morning of
> the fifth day, and the account must be frozen for 90 days. If the
> customer has a payment shortage of
>
> \$1,000 or less, firms have discretion to leave the account unfrozen.
>
> When a customer account is frozen, transactions are limited to sell
> orders and purchases provided the customer has sufficient funds in the
> account prior to the transaction.
>
> If a customer purchases a security and sells the same security without
> first paying for it, the broker-dealer will freeze the customer's
> account and will not release the sales proceeds to the customer until
> the customer pays for the original purchase. This customer activity is
> referred to as **free-riding**---literally meaning that the customer
> got a "free ride" for the shares. If the customer pays for the
> original purchases before the Reg T four-day deadline, the
> broker-dealer lifts the frozen status.
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts
>
> ***Example***
>
> Susan purchases ABC stock on Monday in a regular way transaction,
> which means the trade will settle on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Susan
> sells ABC stock in a cash transac- tion, meaning the transaction will
> receive same-day payment and settlement. Susan then uses those sales
> proceeds to pay for her original purchase. This is free-riding, and
> Susan's account will be frozen.

######### [Margin Accounts]{.underline} 

> **Margin accounts** allow customers to purchase securities using money
> borrowed from a broker-dealer. Securities held in the account serve as
> collateral. Margin accounts allow a customer to take on leverage,
> which can magnify gains or losses in the account. FINRA Rule 4210
> details many of the rules governing margin accounts.

1.  ***Regulation T***

> The Federal Reserve Board's **Regulation T** establishes initial
> margin requirements for the purchase or short sale of securities. When
> purchasing or selling securities short on margin, Reg T requires
> customers to deposit at least 50% of the market value. This allows
> custom- ers to borrow the remaining 50% of the purchase price from
> their broker-dealer. The Reg T deposit amount is also referred to as
> the **initial margin**. Although the Fed can change the initial
> requirement, it has been 50% since 1974.
>
> Securities that are exempt from SEC registration, such as US
> government securities and municipal bonds, are exempt from Regulation
> T as well, and instead must meet the margin requirements established
> by the firm's self-regulatory organization---e.g., FINRA.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Bob wants to purchase \$100,000 of Apple stock on margin. He is
> required to deposit
>
> \$50,000 in cash into the account and can borrow the remaining
> \$50,000 from his bro- ker-dealer. Note that, if Bob wanted to make
> the same purchase using his cash account, he would have to deposit the
> full \$100,000, as cash accounts require customers to pay in full.

2.  ***FINRA Initial Minimum Equity Requirements***

> FINRA imposes further restrictions on initial margin transactions. A
> **minimum initial mar- gin requirement** comes into play for
> transactions of a smaller dollar amount (\$4,000 and under).

-   For **long margin** transactions, the customer must deposit a
    > **minimum of \$2,000 or 100% of the purchase price** of the
    > securities, whichever is less.

-   For **short margin** transactions (customer is selling stock short),
    > the customer must deposit **a minimum of \$2,000**, even if 100%
    > of the sale price of the securities is less.

> For relatively small initial investments, it is likely that the FINRA
> requirement will super- sede Regulation T. For example, an investor
> who purchases \$3,200's worth of stock in a long margin account would
> be required to deposit equity of at least \$2,000 to be compliant with
> FINRA, even though the Reg T requirement is only \$1,600.

> ***[11.2.2.3 FINRA Minimum Maintenance Requirements]{.underline}***
>
> After trading begins, the price of stock held in a margin account is
> subject to market fluc- tuation. To ensure there is sufficient equity
> in the account even when market fluctuations move against the
> customer, FINRA established a **minimum maintenance requirement** that
> must be met at all times.

-   For **long margin** accounts, the FINRA maintenance requirement is
    **25% of the long market value** of the account.

-   For **short margin** accounts, the FINRA maintenance requirement is
    **30% of the short market value** of the account.

> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts
>
> Brokerage firms must ensure that the customer's maintenance margin is
> sufficient at the end of each day. The process of calculating the
> equity required to reflect gains and losses at the end of a trading
> period is called **marking to the market**.

######### Margin Maintenance Calls {#margin-maintenance-calls .unnumbered}

> If the equity in the account falls below the maintenance requirement,
> the customer will receive a **maintenance call**, often referred to as
> a **margin call**, to bring the equity back to the minimum maintenance
> requirement.
>
> ***Example***
>
> In a long margin account, a customer who owns stock worth \$80,000
> must maintain equity of at least \$20,000 (25%). If the customer's
> equity is only \$18,000, the customer will be subject to a \$2,000
> margin call.
>
> Margin accounts that drop below minimum equity levels require "prompt"
> action, per FINRA, though brokerage firms may require *immediate*
> action. If the investor does not sup- ply the required money or
> securities, the firm can sell securities in the account to bring it
> into conformity.
>
> ***[11.2.2.4 Securities Available for Purchase on
> Margin]{.underline}***
>
> Not all securities can be purchased on margin by a customer. The
> Federal Reserve Board determines whether a security is eligible to be
> purchased on margin. Those that may be purchased on margin include:

-   Exchange-listed stocks (e.g., NYSE and Nasdaq listings)

-   OTC stocks approved by the Fed

-   Bonds

-   Closed-end funds

-   Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)

-   LEAPS options with more than nine months until expiration, and

-   fixed-income securities such as Treasury bonds

> The Federal Reserve Board restricts the following securities from
> purchase on margin:

-   Initial public offerings (IPOs) for the first 30 days after the
    > effective date

-   OTC stocks not approved by the Federal Reserve Board

-   Mutual funds

-   Options contracts with nine months or less until expiration, and

-   Annuities

> While mutual funds cannot be purchased in a margin account, they can
> be used as collateral for margin borrowing after they have been held
> for a minimum of 30 days.
>
> ***[11.2.2.5 Margin Agreement]{.underline}***
>
> Now that we have covered the essentials of a margin account, this
> section will explore the **margin agreement**, which customers must
> sign and return to their brokerage firms before they begin trading in
> their margin accounts. The margin agreement has three parts, which are
> discussed below.

######### Hypothecation Agreement {#hypothecation-agreement .unnumbered}

> In the **hypothecation agreement**, the customer agrees to
> hypothecate, or pledge, securi- ties in the account as collateral for
> margin (credit) from the broker-dealer. Hypothecation essentially
> permits customers to take loans against securities they own. The
> customer also agrees that the broker-dealer may re-hypothecate the
> securities in the account, meaning it will re-pledge them as
> collateral to a bank.
>
> To facilitate the hypothecation process, the securities in margin
> accounts must be held in
>
> **street name**, meaning in the name of the broker-dealer.
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts

######### Credit Agreement {#credit-agreement .unnumbered}

> Customers borrow money from their broker-dealers and pay interest on
> the borrowed money at the terms and conditions stated in the **credit
> agreement**. Broker-dealers borrow funds for loans to customers from
> banks at the **broker call rate** and charge interest based on this
> rate (see the sample table below).

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| > **Debit Balance**               | > **Margin Interest Rate**       |
+===================================+==================================+

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

######### Loan Consent Form {#loan-consent-form .unnumbered}

> Technically optional, the third part of the margin agreement, the
> **loan consent form**, autho- rizes the broker-dealer to lend stock
> held in the customer's account to other investors for short sales. For
> this activity to be permitted, FINRA Rule 4330 mandates that customers
> pro- vide written authorization to the firm to allow the borrowing of
> their securities. Additionally,
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts
>
> the firm must provide clear disclosures regarding the risks of short
> sales and its rights with regard to the loaned securities.
>
> ***[11.2.2.6 Margin Account Disclosure]{.underline}***
>
> FINRA Rule 2264 requires firms to provide a **margin disclosure
> statement** to each cus- tomer prior to or at the time of opening the
> account. The statement reminds customers of the risks in margin
> account trading, and must include the following warnings:

-   You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account.

-   The firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your
    > account.

-   The firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting
    > you.

-   You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in
    > your account are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call.

-   The firm can increase its "house" maintenance margin requirements at
    > any time and is not required to provide you advance written
    > notice.

-   You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. This
    > notice is required annually.

######### [Options Accounts]{.underline} 

> This section will focus on the options account opening process, while
> the options market- place and strategies were discussed in an earlier
> chapter.
>
> FINRA mandates that member firms exercise diligence and approve
> customer accounts for options trading, prior to any options
> transaction. The broker-dealer must provide an **options disclosure
> document** at or before the time a **registered options principal
> (ROP)** approves a customer's account for trading options. This
> document details the risk involved in options trading and is prepared
> by the **Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)**.
>
> Note that there are different options approval levels that range from
> less-risky positions, such as covered call writing, to higher-risk
> positions, such as naked call writing. The level of options approval
> is determined by the customer's financial profile and needs.
>
> Customers must sign the **options agreement** within 15 days of
> account approval, thereby agreeing to position limits, which is the
> total number of contracts they can have on each side of the market for
> a given security. By signing the agreement, customers also verify that
> they have read the options disclosure document and understand the
> inherent risks in options trading. If a customer fails to do so within
> 15 days, that customer is limited to liquidating any open options
> positions. Put another way, a customer may not open any new positions
> or exercise any options.

######### [Discretionary Accounts]{.underline} 

> A **discretionary account** exists when a customer gives trading
> authorization to a registered representative. With this authority, the
> representative can determine:

-   Whether to buy or sell (action)

-   What security to buy or sell (asset), and

-   The number of shares involved in the transaction (amount) Note that
    time and price are not discretionary items.

> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts
>
> FINRA Rule 2510 requires that customers grant discretionary authority
> in writing via a power of attorney (POA). Additionally, a principal of
> the firm must approve the account for discretionary trading prior to
> the first trade and must approve each discretionary trade promptly
> after execu- tion. The written authorization and approvals must be
> kept as part of the permanent account file.
>
> In order to authorize the power of attorney, the customer must submit
> a signed copy to the broker-dealer. Even if the firm already has the
> customer's signature on file, it would be prohibited to forge it onto
> a POA as a matter of convenience even if the customer has granted
> approval to do so. This is referred to as a **signature of
> convenience** and applies to any document that is required to be
> signed by the customer.
>
> All powers of attorney end when the person that granted the
> authorization dies.
>
> ***[11.2.4.1 Churning]{.underline}***
>
> Because a registered rep does not need explicit client authorization
> to place trades in a dis- cretionary account, a registered
> representative might be tempted to increase the amount of trades in

> as **churning**. There is not an exact number of trades in an account
> that may constitute churning. Rather, churning is best defined as
> excessive trading that is inconsistent with a customer's investment
> objectives.

######### [Fee-Based Accounts]{.underline} 

> Broker-dealers may offer clients **fee-based accounts**, whereby the
> customer pays a fixed fee or a percentage of assets under management
> rather than paying a commission per transac- tion. Fee-based accounts

> *Chapter 11:* Customer Accounts

#### Progress Check---Solutions {#progress-checksolutions-10 .unnumbered}

1.  (**C**) In cold calls to non-clients, a rep is required to disclose
    his name and the name of

> the firm, a phone number and address where he can be reached, and the
> reason for the call.

2.  (**B**) Unregistered employees are permitted to cold-call, but they
    can only take a call so far.

> If the prospect requests more information, at that point, the call
> must be turned over to a registered person.

3.  (**D**) The only required signature is that of the designated
    principal who approves the new account. By signing, the principal
    verifies that the new account form is complete and that the account
    complies with securities regulations and the firm's policies.

4.  (**C**) In cash accounts, customers must pay in cash, in full, for
    all securities by the fourth business day after the trade date. In
    this case, \$30,000 must be paid in cash within four days, unless
    the firm requests and receives an extension of time. Without an
    extension, the trade will be sold out, and the account will be
    frozen.

5.  (**D**) If an account is frozen for free-riding, the firm is
    permitted to place sell orders and any buy orders for which the
    account has sufficient cash to cover the purchase, at the time the
    order is placed.

6.  (**A**) In a long margin account, the FINRA minimum maintenance
    requirement is 25% of

> the long market value---in this case \$22,500 (\$90,000 Ã 25%). In a
> short margin account, the requirement is 30%.

7.  (**A**) In general, shares that are exchange-traded (ETFs,
    closed-end funds, REITs) can be purchased on margin. Mutual fund
    shares are not exchange-traded and cannot be purchased on margin.
    Although IPOs can be exchange-traded, they cannot be purchased on
    margin for the first 30 days after the effective date.

8.  (**C**) A discretionary trade occurs when the rep decides any of the
    three As: asset, amount,

> or action, without specific instructions from clients. Advocating a
> particular investment or strategy does not, in itself, constitute
> action, provided the client makes the final decision.

###### Titling Customer Accounts

> In addition to opening an individual account, individuals may want to
> open an account with another person or group of people, or they might
> want to open an account for a child or another third party. Different
> account titles have different legal consequences and inher- itance
> consequences upon death.

######### Individual Accounts

> An **individual account** has a single owner who has authority over
> the investments. At the owner's death, open orders are immediately
> cancelled, the account is frozen and marked deceased, and the proceeds
> are distributed to the beneficiary designated by the owner. If no
> beneficiary is designated, proceeds are distributed according to the
> owner's will or trust.
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts

######### Joint Accounts

> **Joint accounts** have two or more owners. In fact, there can be an
> unlimited number of account owners. To set up a joint account, the
> owners must complete the standard new account form as well as a
> **joint account agreement**, which must be signed by all account
> owners. This agreement will stipulate which parties can trade in the
> account, though checks must be made payable to all account owners. The
> two main types of joint accounts are discussed below.
>
> ***[11.3.2.1 Tenants in Common (TIC) Account]{.underline}***
>
> In a **tenants in common (TIC) account**, or **joint tenants in common
> (JTIC) account**, each account holder owns a specified percentage of
> the assets based on their contributions to the account. At each
> owner's death, their portion of the account is liquidated and dis-
> tributed to their designated beneficiary. That person's share *does
> not* pass to the surviving tenants.
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts
>
> ***11.3.2.2 Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship (JTWROS)
> Account***
>
> In a **joint tenants with rights of survivorship (JTWROS) account**,
> each owner has an undivided interest in the entire account, meaning
> all owners own 100% of the assets. If one owner dies, that owner's
> interest in the account passes to the surviving owners. This type of
> account is common for a married couple or for a parent and an adult
> child.

######### [Fiduciary Accounts]{.underline} 

> There are many situations in which one person can open an account on
> behalf of another person whose account she will be responsible for
> managing. Account openers are said to have a **fiduciary
> responsibility**---meaning that the beneficiaries' interests must be
> placed ahead of their own.

1.  ***Minor Accounts***

> Adults can establish securities accounts for minors using the
> **Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)** or the **Uniform Transfers to
> Minors Act (UTMA)**. Some states have adopted UGMA and others have
> adopted UTMA. What is important to know are the characteristics these
> account types share, as opposed to their differences.
>
> Both of these acts require an adult **custodian** to assume a
> fiduciary responsibility in man- aging the account for the minor's
> best interest. The securities are registered in the name of the
> custodian. Once the minor reaches the age of majority, the assets are
> transferred into the name of the new adult. The age of majority is 18
> for an UGMA account and between 18 and 25 for an UTMA account,
> depending on the state.
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts
>
> A minor account must include the custodian's name, as well as the name
> and Social Security number of the minor. These custodial accounts can
> have only one custodian and one minor beneficiary. The custodian, or
> any other adult, can be the giver of the assets, and it need not be a
> parent or guardian. Any gift to the account is irrevocable, meaning
> the donor cannot take back the gift nor can the minor return the gift.
>
> The funds in the account must be used for the benefit of the child,
> and the custodian may be reimbursed for any reasonable expenses
> incurred in managing the account unless the custodian is also the
> donor. If the named custodian should die, the courts will name a suc-
> cessor custodian, typically the minor's guardian or an adult family
> member.
>
> Low-risk investments are most appropriate for custodial accounts.
> Risky strategies such as uncovered options positions and penny stocks
> are considered inappropriate, though they are not outright prohibited.
> Margin trading is not permitted in UGMA or UTMA accounts.
>
> The minor is liable for any taxes generated from capital gains and
> dividend and income distributions, although it is the custodian's
> responsibility to ensure that taxes are paid.
>
> ***[11.3.3.2 Trust Account]{.underline}***
>
> A **trust account** is a legal entity created by a **trustor** (also
> known as a **grantor** or **creator**) and controlled by a **trustee**
> for the benefit of another person, or persons---a trust can be for the
> benefit of multiple individuals or entities. The trustee and
> beneficiary may even be the same person. The trustee acts under powers
> and limits set forth in a **trust agreement**. This individual has
> trading discretion and acts as a fiduciary on behalf of the trust
> beneficiary or beneficiaries. Clients who wish to set up trust
> accounts must provide the broker-dealer a copy of the trust agreement,
> which is usually written by an attorney.
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts
>
> A trust may be revocable or irrevocable. A **revocable trust** may be
> altered or cancelled as the trustor pleases, and the trustee and
> beneficiary may be the same person. An **irrevoca- ble trust** cannot
> be changed or terminated without the agreement of the trust
> beneficiary.

###### Business Accounts

> Just like natural persons, legal entities, such as corporations or
> partnerships, can open bro- kerage accounts.

######### Corporate Accounts

> To set up a **corporate account**, a corporation must provide a
> **corporate resolution** of the board of directors specifying who will
> have trading authority for the account. Additionally, if a corporation
> wants to trade on margin, that must be permitted in its corporate
> charter.
>
> Corporations are considered to have unlimited life, so there is no
> account beneficiary for corporate accounts. Corporations are treated
> as separate entities for income tax purposes, and are subject to
> corporate income tax rates.

######### Partnership Accounts

> A **partnership** is established by an agreement between two or more
> people or entities. A **partnership agreement** binds the parties and
> details which of the partners can transact for the account.
>
> **Investment clubs** are formed by a group of people who share
> investment ideas and pool their money to make common investments. They
> are usually formed as partnerships. However, many broker-dealers
> require that they open a special investment club account to clearly
> designate trading authority and maintain adequate oversight and
> supervision.

###### Maintenance of Customer Accounts

> Once a customer has opened a brokerage account with a broker-dealer,
> it is the firm's respon- sibility to maintain the account and provide
> the customer with ongoing information about the account and related
> activities. It is prohibited for registered representatives to falsify
> or withhold any of this information from their clients.

######### [Customer Account Statements]{.underline} 

> FINRA Rule 2340 requires that any firm that carries or holds accounts,
> funds, or securities for customers send quarterly **account
> statements** to each customer. The statement provides a "snapshot" of
> an account's status as of the statement's closing date. Statements
> must be sent to all customers who have a security position, a money
> balance, or any account activity since the last time the statement was
> sent.
>
> Instead of quarterly statements, firms must send monthly statements to
> customers with active accounts. Activity is defined as purchases,
> sales, interest or dividends received, or any funds flowing in and out
> of the account. Statements allow customers to review their accounts
> for errors, theft, or other potential problems. If the account
> includes any penny stocks or options, monthly statements are required.
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts

######### [Customer Trade Confirmations]{.underline} 

> After customers trade securities, FINRA Rule 2232 and SEC Rule 10b-10
> require firms to send written confirmations containing the trade's
> details. **Trade confirmations** must be delivered to customers at or
> before the completion of each transaction, which is defined as
> **settlement**.
>
> The information recorded on an equity trade confirmation includes:

-   The **date** on which the trade was executed, the name and
    **amount** of securities bought or sold, and the transaction
    **price**

-   The **time** of the trade, or a statement that the time is available
    upon request

-   The **CUSIP ID** that uniquely identifies the securities purchased
    or sold

-   **Trade settlement date**

-   Basic information about the broker-dealer, such as **broker's
    name**, **address**, **and capacity**, i.e., whether it acted as an
    agent or as a principal

    -   Any control relationships between the issuer of the securities
        > and the member firm must be disclosed.

> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts

-   On a principal trade, the confirmation must clearly show the amount
    of any

> **mark-up or mark-down**.

-   On agency trades, the confirmation must show the amount of
    **commission**

> charged.
>
> For context, a sample trade confirmation appears below:
>
> ![](media/image32.png)
>
> MSRB Rule G-15 imposes additional requirements on municipal bond trade
> confirmations. Among relevant items that must be included are:

-   The yield to worst, which is the lower of YTC or YTM

-   Call and put features

-   Amount of accrued interest

-   Yield and dollar price

-   The aggregate price, including the mark-up or mark-down for
    > principal transactions and the commission earned for agency
    > transactions. Note that principal transactions with retail
    > customers fulfilled through same-day inventory (i.e., firm bought
    > the bonds in the market and then resold them to retail customer on
    > same day) must disclose mark-up or mark-down on the trade
    > confirmation.

-   Whether the bond is subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT)

######### Delivery of Annual Reports and Notices of Corporate Actions

> Fundamental rights of shareholders include the right to be informed
> about a company's status and to vote on important matters that affect
> the corporations in which shareholders own equity securities. The
> **proxy voting** process helps investors learn about matters affect-
> ing their investments, allowing them to make their views known to
> company management and participate effectively at an annual or special
> meeting.
>
> FINRA Rule 2251 helps to ensure that customers are provided necessary
> information. If securities are registered in the name of the customer,
> the issuer will send informational notices, such as annual statements
> and voting events, directly to the investor. For securities registered
> in street name, the broker-dealer is responsible for mailing annual
> reports and proxies to the beneficial owners when received.
>
> For convenience, broker-dealers may offer electronic delivery of
> informational documents, though they must mail hardcopy documents if
> the customer prefers that. Broker-dealers are reimbursed by the issuer
> for reasonable costs of distributing materials.

######### Holding Customer Mail

> Under FINRA Rule 3150, broker-dealers are permitted, but not required,
> to **hold customer mail**, such as trade confirmations and account
> statements. To do so, the customer must provide written instructions
> indicating the time period during which the member should hold the
> customer's mail.
>
> If the requested time period is longer than three consecutive months,

1.  Inform the customer in writing of available alternatives to
    monitoring account activity, such as visiting the firm's website or
    opting to receive email notifications

2.  Have the customer confirm receipt of such information, and

3.  Verify at reasonable intervals that the customer's mail-holding
    instructions still apply

######### Customer Account Records

> To ensure that broker-dealers are properly maintaining customer
> accounts and cus- tomer information FINRA Rule 4511 applies
> recordkeeping requirements to all accounts. Specifically, all relevant

> six years after the date the account is closed.

###### Protection of Customer Accounts

> Because broker-dealers have access to customers' sensitive information
> as well as to their securities and other assets, it is essential for
> firms to have measures in place to protect both.

######### Regulation S-P---Information Security

> A broker-dealer's financial transactions with customers involve the
> collection of personal information, including:

-   Names

-   Addresses

-   Phone numbers

-   Bank and credit account numbers

-   Income and credit histories

-   Social Security numbers

> All associated persons of a broker-dealer share the responsibility of
> protecting customer information. The SEC's **Regulation S-P**
> establishes privacy standards to ensure security and confidentiality
> of this data. This law requires firms to provide clients with privacy
> notices explaining their information-sharing practices, while also
> allowing customers to limit some, but not all, sharing of their
> information.
>
> Specifically, broker-dealers must provide clients with a privacy
> notice that explains what information the firm gathers about them,

> information. This privacy notice must be given to a client prior to
> entering into an agreement to do business and annually thereafter.
>
> The privacy notice must also explain to the customer the opportunity

######### [Custody of Securities]{.underline} 

> Once an investor has purchased a security for her brokerage account,
> the broker-dealer must ensure the security is kept in safekeeping for
> as long as the investor owns the security. This process is referred to
> as **custody**. The basic functions of safekeeping securities include:

-   Preventing misuse of investors' assets

-   Segregating client assets from those of the firm, and

-   Supplying space in the vault for physical securities to be kept

> Firms that provide these services are referred to as **custodians**.
> SEC rules require custodi- ans to ensure that customer funds and
> securities are secure and under their possession or control. For
> example, FINRA Rule 4514 prohibits firms or registered representatives
> from withdrawing funds from a customer's account without the
> customer's express written autho- rization---doing so would be a gross
> misuse of investor assets.
>
> SEC rules also require that broker-dealers separate, or segregate,
> fully paid customer posi- tions from the positions of the firm.
> Segregated securities are held apart from the assets of the
> broker-dealer and cannot be used to collateralize loans. Put another
> way, a broker-dealer is prohibited from **commingling** customer and
> firm securities. This important rule prevents a firm from using
> customer securities as collateral for its own purposes and then
> defaulting on a loan and losing a customer's position to the lender.

######### [SIPC Coverage and Protections]{.underline} 

> The **Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)** is a
> nonprofit member corpora- tion created by Congress. SIPC exists to
> increase investors' confidence by protecting cus- tomers of US
> broker-dealers against the loss of their securities due to their
> brokerage firm's failure. Most of SIPC's funding comes from
> broker-dealer assessments, which are based on a percentage of each
> firm's gross revenue from securities.
>
> SIPC ensures that customers of a failed broker-dealer receive all
> non-negotiable securities registered in their names, or those that are
> in the process of being registered. All other so-called **street
> name** securities are then distributed on a pro rata basis. SIPC will
> first attempt to locate and replace any securities lost as a result of
> a broker-dealer bankruptcy.
>
> After replacing securities, SIPC covers any remaining claims up to a
> maximum of \$500,000, including not more than \$250,000 in cash. Any
> additional funds that SIPC recovers through legal actions are used to
> pay investors whose claims exceed the \$500,000 limit.
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts

> ***[11.6.3.1 Separate Customers Under SIPC]{.underline}***
>
> SIPC protection is available to each "separate customer" of the
> broker-dealer, which is deter- mined by an account's title. Thus, a
> natural person could count as multiple "separate custom- ers" for SIPC
> purposes and have full protection (up to \$500,000) on each of their
> accounts.
>
> Each of the following accounts, even if owned or controlled by the
> same person, is a "sepa- rate customer" in SIPC's eyes.

-   An individual account

-   A joint account

-   An account for a trust created under state law

-   An individual retirement account (IRA)

-   A Roth IRA

-   A minor's account

######### [The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)]{.underline} 

> Unlike SIPC, which protects US investors who hold brokerage accounts,
> the **Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)** insures deposits
> in banks and thrift institutions for at least
>
> \$250,000. The FDIC is an independent agency created by Congress in
> 1933 to maintain finan- cial stability and public confidence in the US
> financial system by:

-   Insuring deposits

-   Examining and supervising financial institutions for safety and
    soundness, and

-   Managing receiverships that involve insured institutions. This
    usually means arranging an FDIC-insured transfer of accounts,
    assets, and liabilities of failed banks to healthy banks.

> This coverage is backed by the full faith and credit of the United
> States government and is available to each separate account at
> FDIC-insured institutions. It's important to note that FDIC coverage
> is limited to bank deposit products, such as checking, savings, money

######### [Protection of Vulnerable Investors]{.underline} 

> FINRA rules are designed to protect all types of clients, but
> **vulnerable investors** have recently received increased regulatory
> attention. Included in this group are:

-   Persons age 65 and older, and

-   Any person age 18 and older who a firm or its representatives
    reasonably believe has a mental or physical impairment that renders
    the individual unable to protect their own interests

> FINRA Rule 2165 includes two key steps to protect these investors from
> financial fraud and exploitation. First, firms are required to make
> reasonable efforts to obtain the name and con- tact information for a
> trusted contact person when opening a customer's account. Second,
>
> firms will be permitted to place a temporary hold on a distribution of
> funds or securities from the account for up to 15 business days when
> there is reasonable belief of financial exploitation.
>
> *Chapter 11* Customer Accounts

######### [Disclosure of Financial Condition]{.underline} 

> FINRA Rule 2261 requires broker-dealers to make available to customers
> upon their request information about the firm's financial condition. A
> firm can comply with the rule by provid- ing its most recent balance
> sheet, either via a paper copy or in an electronic format. Broker-
> dealers that are conducting business with another firm must provide
> the same financial disclosures to that counterparty upon its request
> as well. This rule aims to allow customers to more easily investigate

> to give them a sense of assurance that their accounts are in the
> proper hands.

> *Chapter 11:* Customer Accounts

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-10 .unnumbered}

1.  (**C**) Registered reps can only buy or sell securities without
    explicit customer instructions in a discretionary account, and the
    client must give the rep a power of attorney (POA).

> Investment advisers and registered reps often use discretionary
> accounts to implement comprehensive investment strategies, without
> having to get customer approval for every trade.

2.  (**A**) Customers who do not want their names to be attached to
    securities accounts can request that the accounts be identified by
    symbol or number. The customer must still provide a written
    statement of ownership and proof of identity. Using an alias or
    fictional data to open the account is not permitted.

3.  (**A**) Securities brokerage firms have a significant lending
    business, and it is derived from margin accounts. They lend cash to
    customers to buy securities on margin, just as banks lend cash to
    customers. The interest they earn on these loans can be very
    profitable.

4.  (**C**) Since both sales are for \$4,000 or less, they are governed
    by FINRA's initial margin requirement, not Reg T. For any short sale
    up to \$4,000, minimum initial margin is

> \$2,000. For any long purchase up to \$2,000, it is 100% of purchase
> price. For any long purchase of \$2,000 to \$4,000, it is \$2,000.

5.  (**C**) FINRA requires minimum equity equal to at least 25% of long
    market value and 30% of short market value.

6.  (**A**) Brokerage firms must ensure that each customer's maintenance
    margin is sufficient at the end of each trading day. The process of
    calculating the equity reflected in each day's gains or losses is
    called marking to the market.

7.  (**D**) In a minor account, such as an UGMA or UTMA, the minor is
    the owner of the account and therefore it is their Social Security
    number on the account and they are

> liable for any taxes. However, a custodian manages the account on
> behalf of the minor. Any gifts to the account are permanent and cannot
> be revoked or taken away.

8.  (**D**) This example illustrates why joint account titles are so
    important. If the account is titled as joint tenants with rights of
    survivorship ( JTWROS), Ed will get the full account value. Upon
    presentation of a death certificate, it becomes an individual
    account

> in his name. But if it is a tenants in common (TIC) account, Ed will
> only keep
>
> his specified percentage share, and Susan's share will pass to her
> heirs according to her beneficiary designation.

9.  (**A**) Each Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfers
    to Minors Act (UTMA) account must have one adult named as custodian.
    This can be a parent or another trusted person willing to act as
    fiduciary. Keep in mind there can only be one custodian for each
    account.

> *Chapter 11:* Customer Accounts

#### Unit Exam---Solutions (Continued) {#unit-examsolutions-continued-10 .unnumbered}

10. (**D**) There can only be one child beneficiary and one custodian
    per UGMA/UTMA account. All assets must be used for the benefit of
    the beneficiary. For each account, one adult custodian (which may or
    may not be a parent) is legally obligated to act as fiduciary in the
    child's interest.

11. (**D**) Anyone can make gifts in the child's name to the UGMA/UTMA.
    All contributions or gifts immediately and irrevocably become assets
    to be used exclusively for the child's benefit.

12. (**C**) Trade confirmations must be sent on or before settlement
    date. This potentially gives the customer the opportunity to review
    terms of the trade and correct any errors before settlement date.

13. (**B**) Most securities firms allow customers to opt out of
    information sharing with non- affiliated entities, rather than
    rejecting customers who wish to opt out. Customers generally must
    read the firm's privacy notice and then actively request to opt out
    of information sharing.

14. (**B**) The process of safeguarding customer securities and funds
    and segregating customer assets from the brokerage firm's assets is
    called custody. It is generally the responsibility of third-party
    firms called custodians.

15. (**A**) SIPC protects investors against the loss of securities due
    to their brokerage firm's failure. SIPC will first replace any
    securities lost. Then, it will cover remaining claims up to
    \$500,000 per separate customer, but not more than \$250,000 in
    cash. SIPC does

> not protect against theft, embezzlement, fraud, or the loss of
> principal value.

16. (**D**) Each of these accounts is considered a *separate customer*
    for SIPC coverage purposes. All three accounts are SIPC-covered, and
    each account can be reimbursed for lost-cash claims, up to
    \$250,000.

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts and Products

> One of the primary financial goals of any individual is to plan for
> and successfully save for retirement. Many different avenues allow
> investors to save for retirement, including employ- er-sponsored
> plans, individual retirement accounts, and annuities. A main advantage
> of these plans is that the investor's earnings accumulate on a
> **tax-deferred basis**, meaning there is no tax paid on the growth in
> the plan until the money is withdrawn. This allows for compounding
> growth, as the investor can reinvest 100% of the account earnings each
> year without having to pay any taxes.
>
> This chapter will discuss the various types of retirement plans,
> including qualified and non-qualified corporate plans, traditional and
> Roth IRAs, as well as other tax-advantaged accounts, such as
> annuities, 529 plans, and ABLE accounts. It is critical to understand
> the characteristics of each, especially the different tax scenarios
> that apply.

> and Products
>
> amount of income received at retirement is predetermined based on the
> employee's age, position, and tenure with the company

-   **Defined contribution plan**---A type of qualified plan, such as a
    401(k), where retirement income is based on the amount of money
    contributed to the plan and the performance of those investments

-   **Non-qualified corporate retirement plan**---A corporate plan that
    does not meet the guidelines of ERISA and therefore only allows for
    after-tax contributions

-   **Individual retirement account (IRA)**---A retirement account that
    can be opened by an individual with earned income separate from the
    retirement plans offered by their company

-   **Roth IRA**---A special type of retirement account available to
    individuals with lower income that allows for completely tax-free
    distributions of the growth and earnings in the account

-   **Fixed annuity**---A contract between an individual and an
    insurance company that is used to supplement retirement savings and
    guarantees the owner a fixed rate of return for life

-   **Variable annuity**---A contract between an individual and an
    insurance company that is used to supplement retirement savings and
    provides the owner with variable returns over their lifetime based
    on the market performance of the portfolio

-   **Separate account**---The investment account of an insurance
    company where the owner of a variable annuity contract's premiums
    are invested in order to generate market-based returns

-   **529 plan**---A tax-advantaged savings account that allows
    individuals to save for education-related expenses

-   **ABLE account**---A tax-advantaged savings account for individuals
    with disabilities

###### Corporate Retirement Plans

> One benefit provided by many employers to their employees is the
> opportunity to participate in a corporate-sponsored retirement plan.
> Retirement investing allows individuals to create a nest egg for the
> future and provides certain tax benefits that allow the funds to grow
> more quickly over time. This section will discuss the two main types
> of corporate plans: qualified and non-qualified.

######### [Qualified Corporate Retirement Plans]{.underline} 

> In a **qualified corporate retirement plan** employers and employees
> make pre-tax (i.e., tax-deductible) contributions. This means that
> money is invested into the plan before taxes are paid on those funds.
> This cash is then invested into any number of eligible securities and
> those investments will grow **tax-deferred**. This means there is no
> tax each year on any investment earnings, including dividends, capital
> gains, or interest income. When the investor eventually reaches
> retirement age and makes withdrawals from the plan, all distri-
> butions are fully taxable as ordinary income. These tax benefits allow
> for compounding, or faster growth in the account, as they allow 100%
> of the yearly earnings to be reinvested to gain additional income,
> rather than requiring any annual taxes to be paid out.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Over the course of her career, Leigh contributes \$80,000 into her
> qualified corporate retirement plan, which she invests into various
> mutual funds. At the time of retirement, the value of Leigh's funds
> has grown to \$150,000. Leigh is required to pay ordinary income taxes
> on the distribution of the \$150,000.

> ***[12.1.1.1 Employee Retirement Income Security Act
> (ERISA)]{.underline}***
>
> In order for a corporate plan to be qualified and receive these tax
> benefits, it must meet ERISA requirements. The landmark **Employee
> Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)** was passed by Congress in
> 1974 to strengthen the retirement security of private-sector American
> workers.
>
> Every ERISA-covered retirement plan must have at least one fiduciary
> who is legally required to act in the best interest of the plan
> participants.
>
> Additionally, the plan must be **non-discriminatory**, meaning it must
> be offered to every full-time employee who is at least 21 years old
> with one year of service with the employer. Part-time workers who work
> at least 500 hours in three consecutive years must also be eligible to
> participate in the plan.
>
> Finally, the plan requires a **vesting schedule**, which specifies
> when participants have own- ership rights to employer contributions.
> Once benefits are vested, they cannot be taken away because of an
> event, such as the company's bankruptcy or an employee's dismissal
> from work. For example, the schedule might say that if the employee
> leaves the company after two years of employment, he only gets to keep
> 50% of employer contributions, but if he leaves after four years, he
> gets to keep 100% of employer contributions.
>

2.  ***Defined Benefit Plans***

> A **defined benefit plan** is 100% funded by the employer and promises
> to pay each partici- pant a specified income benefit at retirement
> age. The benefit may be set at a dollar amount or by a formula that
> takes into account salary, age, and years of work service. Traditional
> **pension plans** are usually defined benefit plans.
>
> ***Example***
>
> A defined benefit plan promises to pay a participant a monthly benefit
> that equals 1% of that person's average monthly salary in the last
> three years of employment, multiplied by years of total service. A
> participant who has worked 30 years might receive a monthly retirement
> income check equal to 30% of average salary.
>
> Defined benefit plans do not have individual employee accounts.
> Rather, all company con- tributions are deposited into a trust and
> professionally managed to produce investment returns that are designed
> to meet the required retirement benefits. The employer bears 100% of
> investment responsibility and must make additional contributions if
> investment performance is poor or fails to attain the plan's goals.
> The employer must hire a professional known as an **actuary** to
> calculate the amount of annual contributions required to fund promised
> future benefits for all employed and retired participants. If the
> investments do not perform as expected, there is a risk of an
> **underfunded pension plan**, meaning there are not sufficient assets
> to pay retirement obligations.
>
> The complexity and administrative costs of defined benefit plans have
> caused many employ- ers to discontinue offering them, and to offer
> defined contribution plans instead.

3.  ***Defined Contribution Plans***

> Recently, the trend in retirement plans has been toward **defined
> contribution plans**. These allow both employers and employees to make
> contributions to accounts. Unlike with defined benefit plans, no
> minimum benefit is promised. Instead, the participant's retirement
> income is based on the amount contributed to the plan and the
> performance of the chosen invest- ments. Once participants reach
> retirement age, they take distributions from the plan.
>
> There are a number of different types of retirement plans.

######### 401(k) Plans {#k-plans .unnumbered}

> **401(k) plans** have become the most popular and prevalent type of
> employer-sponsored retirement plan in the US. They are a type of
> defined contribution plan that allows each eligible employee the
> option of deferring a portion of her salary into the plan instead of
> receiving current pay in cash.
>
> Employers have the option of matching all or part of each employee's
> deferrals in addition to, or instead of, making profit-sharing
> contributions to the plan. 401(k) participation and contribution rates
> are much higher in plans with generous employer matching. Participants
> in 401(k) plans direct their own investment choices.
>
> ***Example***
>
> ABC Company agrees to match 50% of each worker's elective deferral up
> to 5% of salary. Jim, an employee, earns \$100,000 and defers 10% of
> his pay---\$10,000 per year. The com- pany matches 50% of the first
> \$5,000 of his elective deferral, for a matching contribution of
> \$2,500. Each year, Jim's 401(k) grows by total contributions of
> \$12,500, plus investment earnings.

######### Roth 401(k) Accounts {#roth-401k-accounts .unnumbered}

> Since 2006, 401(k) plans have been allowed to add a Roth account
> feature. Technically, a **Roth 401(k)** is an optional Roth account,
> which may be offered by the employer, to which each participant may
> choose to contribute in addition to their regular 401(k)
> contributions. The Roth account works like a Roth IRA inside the plan.
> Only employee contributions go in the Roth account; employer match
> contributions are made to the regular 401(k) account.
>
> All employee deferrals to the Roth account are made post-tax. Roth
> distributions will be received by the participant tax-free if they are
> taken at least five years after the first Roth deferral, and the
> participant is at least age 59 Â½ when the first distribution is made.
> Roth IRAs will be reviewed in detail in a later section.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Roy defers \$2,000 into his regular 401(k) account and another \$1,000
> into his Roth 401(k) account. His employer matches 100% of his
> contributions. All \$3,000 of employer contri- butions will go into
> the regular 401(k) account.

######### Profit-Sharing Plans {#profit-sharing-plans .unnumbered}

> **Profit-sharing plans** are a type of defined contribution plan that
> gives employers the flexi- bility to vary the level of annual
> contributions each year based on the company's profits. The same
> percentage of compensation generally must be contributed for all
> eligible employees. Typically, these plans are combined with 401(k)s,
> allowing for both an employee deferral contribution as well as a
> company contribution based on profits.

######### Keogh Plans {#keogh-plans .unnumbered}

> Generally established as defined contribution plans, **Keogh plans**,
> also referred to as **HR-10 plans**, are qualified plans that allow
> self-employed individuals and owners of unincorpo- rated businesses to
> contribute for retirement on behalf of themselves and their employees.
> Because of certain legislative changes, new Keogh plans are seldom set
> up, though many are still in existence.

>
> Because ERISA plans are only available to private-sector employees,
> those who work for nonprofits or in the public sector are not eligible
> to participate. However, in lieu of the ERISA plans discussed, they
> are eligible to participate in similar types of qualified plans, which
> are discussed below.

######### 403(b) Plans {#b-plans .unnumbered}

> **403(b) plans** are ERISA plans sponsored by nonprofit organizations
> and educational insti- tutions. Like 401(k)s, they allow participants
> to make elective deferrals. They are also called **tax-sheltered
> annuities (TSAs)** and may be created for the benefit of employees of
> pub- lic schools, employees of 501(c)(3) tax-exempt
> organizations---which are charities---and employees of certain types
> of religious institutions.

######### 457(b) Plans {#b-plans-1 .unnumbered}

> **457(b) plans** are participant-directed, ERISA, deferred
> compensation plans sponsored by state or local government entities, as
> well as tax-exempt 501(c) organizations. In virtually all respects,
> they work the same as 401(k) and 403(b) plans, with the same tax
> treatment and contribution limits.

######### [Non-Qualified Corporate Plans]{.underline} 

> **Non-qualified corporate plans** offer employers the opportunity to
> avoid the strict require- ments of qualified plans. A non-qualified
> plan's main advantages include:

-   Flexibility to choose which employees participate

-   Flexibility to structure the plan so that it offers greater reward
    to the most valuable executives

-   Avoidance of nondiscrimination tests (because they are not
    ERISA-covered)

-   No limits on the amount of income that can be contributed

> Unlike qualified retirement plans, non-qualified plans do not create
> an immediate tax deduc- tion for the company, meaning they are
> **non-deductible** or **after-tax**. Instead, the company sets money
> aside for the future use of key employees. As long as employees have
> no current ownership or control of assets, they do not pay current
> income tax. Typically, tax is owed by the employee and companies take
> tax deductions when plan benefits are distributed.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Robin is the CEO of XYZ Company. As a benefit to her, the company
> provides her a non-qualified corporate plan and funds it by
> contributing a total of \$500,000. When Robin reaches retirement, the
> account value has grown to \$700,000. Because the company's
> contributions are after-tax, Robin is only required to pay ordinary
> income taxes on the growth of \$200,000.

> One major risk of a non-qualified plan is the potential loss of

> The table below summarizes the various types of corporate retirement
> plans:

###### Individual Retirement Accounts

> **Individual retirement accounts (IRAs)** are the largest component of
> the US retirement market. IRAs were created to extend retirement plan
> coverage to individuals not covered by a workplace plan and to allow
> those that are covered to receive additional retirement benefits. IRAs
> allow individuals with earned income to open their own personal
> retirement accounts, separate from their employer. These accounts are
> typically opened by the individ- ual with a bank or broker-dealer.
>
> This section will describe both traditional and Roth IRAs.

######### [Traditional IRAs]{.underline} 

> **Traditional IRAs** are the most popular type of IRA. Persons who
> work and earn compensa- tion, along with their spouses, can set up a
> traditional IRA and make annual contributions.
>
> There is no minimum age, so even a child with compensation is allowed
> to contribute to a traditional IRA. The maximum contribution as of
> 2021 is the lesser of \$6,000 or 100% of the individual's annual
> earned income, which includes wages, salary, and commissions.
> Described differently, an individual can contribute up to \$6,000 of
> earned income to an IRA. In addition, individuals age 50 or over may
> add an annual **catch-up contribution** of
>
> \$1,000, bringing the total to \$7,000. If the limit is exceeded, a 6%
> penalty is assessed on the excess amount.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Harry is a college student who has a part-time job. He earns \$4,000
> in a year. He can con- tribute up to \$4,000 to his IRA in that
> year---100% of his compensation. If Harry earned more than \$6,000 in
> a year, the most he could contribute is \$6,000.
>
> *Chapter 12*

######## Tax-Advantaged Accounts {#tax-advantaged-accounts-7 .unnumbered}

> and Products
>
> Traditional IRAs are personal accounts, always held in one
> individual's name, never jointly. However, if a working spouse has a
> traditional IRA, that person can make a contribution in a separate
> traditional IRA on behalf of a non-working spouse with no
> compensation. This separate IRA is referred to as a **spousal IRA**.
>
> ***Example***
>
> John and Helen, a married couple, have total compensation of \$80,000,
> all earned by John. John is 52 and Helen is 48. John can contribute
> \$7,000 (regular + catch-up) to his traditional IRA, and he can
> contribute \$6,000 to Helen's plan.
>
> All IRA contributions must be made by the due date of the individual's
> next federal income tax return, which is usually April 15.
>
> ***Example***
>
> An individual can contribute for 2018 until April 15, 2019.

1.  ***Account and Investment Requirements***

> Investors typically make cash contributions to their IRAs and from
> there have broad dis- cretion to invest in many types of assets,
> including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs.
>
> Several types of investments are prohibited in IRAs. They include:

-   Fixed life insurance

-   Antiques and collectibles, other than certain US-issued gold and
    silver coins

-   Certain risky options positions, such as uncovered calls, and

-   Real estate

    1.  ***Traditional IRA Contributions***

> Traditional IRA contributions can be **pre-tax** or **post-tax**. The
> three potential scenarios are below.

1.  An individual can have a tax-deductible (pre-tax) IRA if they are
    not eligible to participate in a corporate plan. For example, the
    individual's employer does not offer them.

##### 373 {#section-4 .unnumbered}

######## Tax-Advantaged Accounts {#tax-advantaged-accounts-8 .unnumbered}

> and Products

2.  An individual can have a tax-deductible (pre-tax) IRA if they are
    eligible for a corporate plan, but make below a certain amount of
    income (the exact numbers are not important for the exam).

3.  An individual can have a non-deductible (after-tax) IRA if they are
    eligible for a corporate plan and make over a certain amount of
    income (the exact numbers are not important for the exam).

> If an individual makes pre-tax contributions to their IRA, it grows
> tax-deferred, and all dis- tributions are fully taxed ordinary income
> (scenarios 1 and 2).
>
> If an individual makes after-tax contributions to their IRA, it grows
> tax-deferred, and only the earnings, i.e., the growth, in the plan are
> taxable as ordinary income (scenario 3).
>
> ***Example***
>
> Jordan works for a technology start-up making \$200,000 per year.
> Because Jordan's employer does not offer him a corporate plan, Jordan
> can contribute pre-tax dollars to his IRA. However, if Jordan's
> employer introduces a corporate plan to its employees, Jordan will now
> only be allowed to make after-tax contributions to his IRA (because he
> makes over the income threshold).
>
> ***[12.2.1.3 Distributions from a Traditional IRA]{.underline}***
>
> Withdrawals from traditional IRAs may begin without penalty at age 59
> Â½.
>
> If a withdrawal is made by a traditional IRA owner prior to age 59 Â½,
> a 10% penalty is due unless an exception applies.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Frank is downsized by his employer and needs to tap his traditional
> IRA for cash at age
>
> 55\. He withdraws \$20,000, all of which were tax-deductible
> contributions. He will add
>
> \$20,000 to his taxable income for the year of withdrawal and pay a
> \$2,000 (10%) penalty.
>
> Exceptions to the 10% penalty for early withdrawals include:

-   Disability of the account owner

-   Payment of education expenses for the account owner, her spouse,
    > children, and grandchildren

-   First-time homebuyers (limited to \$10,000)

-   Medical expenses

-   Death of the account owner

-   Birth or adoption of a child (limited to \$5,000 per parent)

> ***[12.2.1.4 Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)]{.underline}***
>
> Owners of traditional IRAs are required to begin taking **required
> minimum distributions (RMDs)** by April 1 of the year following their
> turning 72. Note that this date was increased from
>
> 70.5 on January 1, 2020 by the Secure Act. This date of the first
> required distribution is referred to as the **required beginning date
> (RBD)**. After this date, RMDs must be made annually by the end of
> each subsequent calendar year. RMDs must continue each year for as
> long as the owner is alive or until all funds have been depleted. IRA
> owners may take a larger distribution than required by the RMD
> calculation. The IRS requires these distributions so that it can
> generate tax revenue on funds that may have previously been sheltered
> from taxation.
>
> The RMD depends on the account value and the owner's life expectancy,
> as published in IRS tables.
>
> Failure to take an RMD subjects the account owner or beneficiary to
> pay 50% excise tax on the under-distributed amount.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Leonard forgot to take an IRA distribution to meet his RMD requirement
> at age 74. The RMD for the year was \$10,000. He must pay tax of
> \$5,000 on the shortfall.

######### [Roth IRAs]{.underline} 

> **Roth IRAs** are like traditional IRAs in several ways:

-   The dollar limits on annual contributions are the same---\$6,000
    plus a \$1,000 catch-up for those age 50 and over. The contribution
    is limited to 100% of earned income.

-   Owners have discretion to invest assets in a variety of investment
    choices, and the prohibited transactions are the same as in
    traditional IRAs.

-   Earnings accumulate on a tax-deferred basis---i.e., without current
    tax consequence.

> Roth IRAs have these significant differences from traditional IRAs:

-   Roth IRA contributions are available only to taxpayers who have an
    income below a certain limit. Once a person's income exceeds the
    limit she can no longer contribute to the plan.

-   Roth IRA contributions are always made with after-tax dollars
    (non-deductible).

-   Distributions from Roth IRAs are tax-free.

-   RMDs are never required from Roth IRAs during the account owner's
    lifetime.

#### Progress Check---Solutions {#progress-checksolutions-11 .unnumbered}

1.  (**B**) Distributions can be tax-free in Roth IRAs because
    contributions are made with *after- tax dollars*. Rather than the
    tax benefit occurring on the front-end of the investment, it occurs
    on the back end. Contributions in Roth IRAs are always distributed
    tax-free, and earnings are distributed tax-free if the distributions
    are made after age 59 Â½ and after the Roth has been open for five
    years.

2.  (**A**) ERISA applies to private-sector, employer-sponsored plans
    such as 401(k)s and defined benefit plans. It does not apply to
    plans for government workers or individual account plans such as
    traditional and Roth IRAs.

3.  (**D**) When plan benefits are vested, they belong to the employee.
    Under ERISA, an employee's own contributions are always immediately
    100% vested. Corporate plans can elect to vest employer
    contributions on a delayed basis, but the years of delay cannot
    exceed ERISA guidelines.

4.  (**D**) Although most employers make matching or profit-sharing
    contributions (or both), there is no requirement to do so.

5.  (**C**) A short list of investments is not permitted in IRAs. It
    includes life insurance, antiques and collectibles, options, and
    physically owned real estate. REITs (real estate securities) are
    permitted, as are mutual funds. Although municipal bonds are not
    appropriate investments, technically, they are not prohibited
    either.

6.  (**A**) All earnings in all types of IRAs grow tax-deferred until
    money is distributed. It does not matter if the contributions were
    pre-tax or after-tax.

7.  (**B**) The first RMD is required by the April 1st following an
    individual's 72nd birthday.

8.  (**D**) RMDs are never required from Roth IRAs during the account
    owner's lifetime. They can continue to accumulate tax-deferred until
    the account owner's death. This is a major difference between Roth
    IRAs and traditional IRAs, and it is a benefit of Roths compared to
    traditional IRAs.

######  Annuities

> **Annuities** are another investment vehicle that aims to help
> individuals save for retirement. These products, which are offered by
> insurance companies, pay a stream of income that is guaranteed for the
> life of the contract owner, known as the **annuitant**. While life
> insurance is designed to protect against dying too soon, annuities are
> said to protect against living too long, and subsequently running out
> of savings.
>
> Annuities can be deferred or immediate. **Deferred annuities**
> accumulate earnings until a future date when payments of income to the
> annuitant begin. A deferred annuity can be purchased with either a
> single premium or periodic payments. **Immediate annuities** begin
> payments shortly after the contract is issued (usually within one
> month to one year). The payment amount varies by the age of the
> individual, the contribution amounts, and the earnings applied to the
> purchase payments. A longer deferral period allows the annuity to
> accumulate more earnings, which increases the amount of the potential
> payout.
>
> Contracts typically have a minimum payment amount, called the
> **premium**. A contract may be funded with a single premium, a lump
> sum payment, or periodic payments that can be paid on a predetermined
> schedule or flexible schedule, depending on the purchaser's
> preference.
>
> One of the main benefits of annuities is that, like retirement plans,
> the investments grow tax-deferred. This means that an investor will
> not pay taxes each year on the earnings or growth in the plan. The
> investor only pays taxes when he takes distributions.

######### [The Separate Account and Annuity Regulation]{.underline} 

> An insurance company that offers both fixed and variable products
> manages its investments through two types of accounts. The **general
> account** of the insurance company invests customer premiums into
> conservative investment options, such as Treasury securities and
> high-grade corporate bonds, that deliver guaranteed returns to
> investors who own fixed insurance products. The general account
> usually has little equity exposure because of the need to continually
> deliver these guarantees to the owner.
>
> Premiums paid for variable annuities are invested into the insurance
> company's **separate account**, which is the foundation of variable
> products. Within the separate account, inves- tors will direct their
> contributions into various **subaccounts**. These accounts function
> like mutual funds, with various risk and reward profiles. A wide
> variety of subaccount invest- ment objectives can be selected to align
> with an annuity owner's needs and risk tolerance.

> Sometimes insurers manage separate accounts with their own investment
> managers. Alternatively, management responsibilities can be delegated
> to mutual fund subaccount managers.
>
> From a regulatory perspective, the separate account is considered an
> investment company and is subject to registration under the Investment
> Company Act of 1940. Provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
> Securities Exchange Act of 1934 also apply to variable annuities. The
> separate account manager is subject to the Investment Advisers Act of
> 1940.

######### [Fixed Annuities]{.underline} 

> **Fixed annuities** offer both guaranteed principal and a guaranteed
> fixed rate of interest for the term of the contract, which is managed
> through the insurance company's general account. They accumulate a
> stated amount of interest and guarantee that a certain amount of
> income will be paid. With a fixed annuity "what you see is what you
> get"---there is no variability to the investment returns or payments.
>
> Importantly, the insurance company, not the investor, bears the
> investment risk, meaning that no matter how the market is performing,
> the insurance company must always pay the investor the guaranteed
> fixed rate. Because investors do not bear the risk, fixed annuities
> are not securities, and individuals selling these products only
> require an insurance license, not a securities registration.
>
> The convenience and predictability of a constant, fixed payout make a
> fixed annuity popular with individuals who want a known income stream
> to supplement their other retirement income, and are wary of the stock
> market's ups and downs. However, these fixed payments may not keep
> pace with the rate of inflation.
>
> Because fixed annuities are not securities, they are lightly tested.

######### [Variable Annuities]{.underline} 

> Unlike their fixed counterparts, **variable annuities** are designed
> to boost retirement sav- ings by offering returns based on market
> performance. Because of this, they are resistant to inflation and
> provide the possibility of greater returns. Variable annuities do this
> by allowing the contract owner to invest in the insurance company's
> separate account in a broad range of professionally managed investment
> options, typically mutual funds. Contract owners may choose
> investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth.
> The value of a variable annuity will vary, depending on the
> performance of the investment options that were chosen.
>
> Variable annuities are similar in structure to retirement plans,
> albeit with some insur- ance-like differences.
>
> Because investors take on the investment risk in variable annuities,
> variable annuities are considered securities and must be registered
> with the SEC and sold with a prospectus. The prospectus contains
> important information about the annuity contract, including fees and
> charges, investment options, death benefits, and annuity payout
> options.

1.  ***Accumulation Phase***

> The **accumulation phase** is the time during which an annuity owner
> is putting money into the contract. The purchaser can choose to invest
> with a lump sum purchase or on a periodic-payment basis.
>
> The dollars invested into the contract purchase **accumulation
> units**. Each unit represents an interest in an underlying subaccount.
> The value of a unit fluctuates according to the value of securities in
> the portfolio, just like a share in a mutual fund. Its value is
> recalculated daily.
>
> During the accumulation phase, investors also have an insurance-like
> feature called a **guar- anteed death benefit**. If the investor dies
> during this period, the investor's beneficiary receives the greater of
> the current value of the contract or the amount contributed (in the
> case that the contract's market value has decreased). The death
> benefit usually ends upon the annuitization of the account.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Jillian funds a variable annuity by contributing \$100,000. Over the
> next five years, the value of the annuity grows to \$150,000. If
> Jillian passes away during the accumulation phase, her beneficiary,
> Joe, receives \$150,000 (the greater of the current value and amount
> invested). However, if Jillian's investment had decreased to \$80,000,
> Joe would receive \$100,000 (the amount invested).

2.  ***Annuitization Phase***

> The second phase of the annuity is **annuitization**, where the
> investor can begin taking income from the plan. As with IRAs,
> distributions can begin at age 59 Â½ with early with- drawals subject
> to a 10% penalty on the earnings.
>
> When the contract is annuitized, the accumulation units are converted
> into a fixed number of **annuity units**. The value of the annuity
> units determines the amount of the payment the annuitant will receive
> each month. The payout amount under these circumstances is variable,
> which means it will fluctuate in value, and each payment may be worth
> a different amount. While the amount of the payment may change from
> month to month, the annuitant is guaranteed that payments will be made
> for life.
>

######## Tax-Advantaged Accounts {#tax-advantaged-accounts-15 .unnumbered}

> and Products
>
> ***[12.3.3.3 Payout Options]{.underline}***
>
> The monthly payment will also be influenced by the payout option
> selected by the investor before annuitization. Once a choice has been
> made, it cannot be changed. Insurance com- panies offer several payout
> options.

######### Straight Life {#straight-life .unnumbered}

> A **straight life** guarantees payments for life to the annuitant,
> regardless of how long that person lives. However, no payments are
> made to the beneficiary upon death. Even if the annuitant dies after
> receiving only a single payment, the insurance company is not
> obligated to make any further payments. Because of the high risk
> associated with this option, it has the highest monthly payout amount.

######### Life with Period Certain {#life-with-period-certain .unnumbered}

> A **life with period certain** option guarantees payments for life
> with a minimum period of time during which payments must be made to
> the annuitant or their beneficiary. If the annu- itant outlives this
> timeframe, they still continue to collect payments until death.
> However, the beneficiary is only protected during the period certain.
> A period of 10 or 15 years is common.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Howard has a life annuity with a 10-year period certain. If Howard
> passes away after year six, his beneficiary will continue to receive
> payments for the remaining four years of the period certain. If Howard
> instead passes away after year 17, he will receive payments during the
> entire period, but once he dies, no payments will be made to his
> beneficiary.

######### Joint with Last Survivor {#joint-with-last-survivor .unnumbered}

> A **joint with last survivor** option ensures that income will
> continue through the death of a second annuitant, regardless of who
> dies first. A common option for married couples, this option results
> in the smallest monthly benefit because it has the strongest guarantee
> and longest expected duration.
>
> ***[12.3.3.4 Surrender Charges]{.underline}***
>
> Several charges apply to variable annuities, which can negatively
> impact the owner's return on investment. One important fee is
> **surrender charges**, which applies when money is withdrawn from the
> annuity within a certain period of a purchase payment. They are a type
> of back-end sales charge that ensures the insurance company recoups
> the cost of
>
> sales commissions that are paid to the registered representative when
> the product is sold. Surrender charges commonly apply for six to 10
> years from the time of purchase. They are assessed as a percentage of
> the amount withdrawn and generally decline over the surrender charge
> period.

> ***[12.3.3.5 Taxation of Variable Annuities]{.underline}***
>
> One of the most attractive benefits of variable annuities is
> tax-deferred growth. This benefit applies to annuities while in the
> accumulation phase. Similar to retirement plans, the div- idends,
> interest, and capital gains earned on investments are reinvested
> without incurring tax.
>
> When free of annual taxation on gains and distributions, funds within
> variable annuities can accumulate at a much more rapid pace than when
> taxed.
>
> Once withdrawals are made from annuity contracts, tax consequences
> will apply.

######### Taxation on Withdrawals {#taxation-on-withdrawals .unnumbered}

> Most annuity contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Therefore,
> if a withdrawal is made by an annuity owner, income taxes are due on
> the difference between the amount paid into the annuity (i.e., basis)
> and its total value.
>
> Note that if the annuity was part of a qualified retirement plan, for
> example a 403(b) plan, and all contributions were made with pre-tax
> dollars, all distributions would be subject to ordinary income
> taxation. In addition, as previously mentioned, any withdrawals prior

######### Variable Annuity Sale Recommendations {#variable-annuity-sale-recommendations .unnumbered}

> A sale is not to be recommended unless a representative has reason to
> believe the product and any subaccounts chosen are suitable for the
> customer and that the customer would benefit from the features of the
> variable annuity. The customer must have been informed of the
> following:

-   The potential surrender period and surrender charges

-   Potential tax penalty if customers take distributions before
    reaching age 59 Â½

-   Fees paid for management of the subaccounts

-   Sales charges paid to the rep

-   The insurance and investment components (e.g., death benefits and
    separate account), and

-   Market risk associated with investing in the product

> costly to own, and reinforce that they are designed for long-term
> investors.

###### Tax-Advantaged Savings for Education and Individuals with Disabilities

> As discussed previously, **municipal fund securities** are investment
> pools like mutual funds, but they are instead issued by a state or
> local government entity. Two types of municipal fund securities---ABLE
> accounts and 529 plans---have a tax-advantaged structure similar to
> those of the accounts and products discussed so far in this chapter.
> As with retirement investments and annuities, no annual taxation
> applies to the growth in these plans, mean- ing any capital gains,
> dividends, and interest income can be fully reinvested back into the
> funds without taxation. Instead, they provide certain tax benefits to
> help those saving for education as well as with expenses for those
> with disabilities.

######### [529 College Savings Plans]{.underline} 

> **529 college savings plans** enable tax-favored savings and
> investment for payment of qual- ified education expenses. These
> programs are established and maintained by states. All states
> currently offer 529 plans, which include a variety of investment
> options. An individual can open a plan in any state; the beneficiary
> does not need to go to school there. However, certain tax benefits may
> exist for investing in your home state. All states provide a **program
> disclosure document**, which includes a description of their plans.
>
> In addition to savings plans, some states and educational institutions
> have established pre- paid tuition plans which allow for the
> prepayment of future tuition at one or more designated
>
> colleges, often limited to designated public colleges within the
> state. In some cases, the cost of future tuition is locked in at the
> time of purchase. These plans are much less popular and therefore this
> section will focus on the characteristics of savings plans.

1.  ***Establishing a Plan***

> Any adult may set up and contribute to a 529 plan for a designated
> beneficiary. The desig- nated beneficiary, typically a minor, does not
> have to be a relative of the contributor, but the beneficiary must be
> an existing child (i.e., not an unborn child). Additionally, there is
> no requirement to have earned income in the year of the contribution.
> All plan contributions are made with post-tax dollars, and maximum
> contributions vary by state.
>
> *Chapter 12*

######## Tax-Advantaged Accounts {#tax-advantaged-accounts-18 .unnumbered}

> and Products
>
> The account owner retains control over plan assets, including the
> ability to select invest- ments. The owner retains control until the
> money is withdrawn and spent. Additionally, the owner has the right to
> change the designated beneficiary, at any time, without tax conse-
> quences, provided the new beneficiary is a family member of the old
> beneficiary.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Ted has two children, Barbara, age 14, and Henry, age 11. He sets up a
> 529 savings plan and names Barbara the designated beneficiary. Over
> several years, Ted makes contribu- tions and the account grows in
> value. However, Barbara decides not to go to college. Ted may change
> the beneficiary to Henry and continue making contributions for Henry's
> college education. Later, Ted could change the beneficiary from Henry
> to a grandchild, if he wanted.

2.  ***Investment Options***

> A variety of investment objectives are available within 529 plans.
> Some state plans offer age-based investment options, in which the
> underlying investments become more conser- vative as the beneficiary
> gets closer to college age. They also offer risk-based investment
> options, in which the underlying investments remain in the same fund,
> or combination of funds, regardless of the beneficiary's age.
> Guaranteed or insured products are also offered to protect principal.
>
> *Chapter 12*

3.  ***Distributions of 529 Plans***

> In most states, municipal securities firms are engaged to sell 529
> plans. In that case, inves- tors may open an account through one of
> those authorized firms. These plans are called **adviser-sold plans**.
>
> Investors may also choose to deal directly with the 529 plan. These
> plans are called **direct-sold plans**. The investor can access the
> fund through a primary distributor or directly through state
> personnel. Fees and charges may be lower in a direct-sold plan, though
> investors may not have access to the advice of an investment
> professional like they do with adviser-sold plans.

4.  ***Qualified Education Expenses***

> The purpose of a 529 plan is to help with payment of qualified higher
> education expenses. A qualified education expense is one for college,
> university, a vocational school, or another post-secondary institution
> that is eligible to participate in a federal student financial aid
> program. Virtually all accredited colleges and universities in the US
> qualify.
>
> To be qualified, expenses must be required by the institution.
> Qualified expenses include tuition, books, supplies, equipment,
> technology fees, internet service fees, and expenses for special needs
> students.
>
> Room and board is a qualified education expense only if the student is
> enrolled at least half-time. In this case, expenses may not exceed the
> allowance for room and board, as deter- mined by the institution.
>
> While historically, 529 plans could only be used for higher education
> expenses, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed at the end of 2017 expanded
> the usage of these accounts to elementary or secondary school. Now, up
> to \$10,000 can be distributed annually from the plan to cover the
> costs associated with elementary school and high school.
>
> As of January 1, 2020, the SECURE Act included an additional provision
> allowing up to
>
> \$10,000 to be used to pay student loan debt.

5.  ***Federal Tax Benefits***

> As mentioned, 529 plans offer a tax-advantaged way to save for
> education. Specifically, own- ers contribute after-tax dollars into
> the plan. The investments within the plan grow tax-free, meaning the
> investment earnings generated each year are not taxed. Distributions
> used to pay for qualified education expenses are also tax-free. Note
> that, although distributions are tax-free at the federal level,
> certain state tax consequences may apply, which will be discussed
> shortly.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Ali's 529 plan consists of \$175,000 of after-tax contributions. Over
> time, the assets in the plan grow to be valued at \$275,000. When Ali
> takes distributions to pay for college, the growth in the plan of
> \$100,000 is completely tax-free.
>
> Also note that any distributions from the plan that are not used for
> qualified education expenses are subject to ordinary income tax as
> well as a 10% federal penalty.
>
> ***[12.4.1.6 State Tax Consequences of 529 Plans]{.underline}***
>
> States offer 529 plans to help individuals save for higher education.
> In order to incentivize state residents to open in-state plans,
> certain tax benefits might be offered. For example, some states allow
> a certain portion of the money contributed into the plan to be tax-de-
> ductible and allow for tax-free distributions at the state level.
>
> In contrast, some states penalize their residents for opening
> out-of-state plans. For example, if an investor opens a plan in
> another state, although that investor receives federally tax-free
> distributions, she may be required by her state of residency to pay
> state taxes on the plan's growth.
>
> Because these plans are sponsored by states, they are subject to MSRB
> regulation, which requires registered representatives to disclose
> potential out-of-state tax consequences to investors at or prior to
> the sale of securities involved in an out-of-state 529 plan.

***[12.4.1.7 MSRB Reporting Requirements]{.underline}***

> MSRB Rule G-45 requires underwriters of 529 plans and ABLE programs
> (discussed below) to electronically submit certain information to the
> MSRB about the investment. Specifically, three categories of
> information need to be submitted semiannually:

1.  Information describing the plan, such as which state is offering it,
    and the name of the plan and plan manager.

2.  Aggregate plan information, such as total plan assets as well as
    contributions and distributions during the period.

3.  Investment option information, such as the available investment
    options and their objectives, the name and allocation percentage of
    each underlying investment within each option, expense data, and
    performance data.

> These reporting requirements do not apply to local government
> investment pools (LGIPs), which were discussed in an earlier chapter.

> Additionally, Coverdell funds must be spent or transferred to a family

> **ABLE accounts** were created by the ABLE ("Achieving a Better Life
> Experience") Act of 2014. The act helps ease the financial strain of
> individuals with disabilities by permitting the opening of tax-free
> savings accounts that can cover qualified expenses, such as education,
> housing, transportation, employment support and training, and health
> and wellness ser- vices. These savings accounts can supplement
> benefits provided through private insurances, social programs, and
> other sources.
>
> Like Section 529 plans, ABLE accounts are available in all states and
> share similar contribu- tion limits, tax treatment, and reporting
> requirements.

> **Explanation:** A form of defined contribution plan, 401(k) plans
> permit employees to make con- tributions (elective deferrals).
> Employees bear all investment risk in these plans, and money allo-
> cated to stock investments can help retirement benefits increase, if
> the stock market is strong.

> Defined benefit plans are 100% funded by the employer, and the
> employer bears all investment risk. In defined benefit plans, benefits
> are typically based on a combination of years or work service and
> salary. The amount in contributions employers must make is determined
> by actuarial calculations that determine the funding required to
> support all promised future benefits. Both types of plans feature
> tax-deferral on earnings and ERISA's protections for participants.

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-11 .unnumbered}

1.  (**D**) Contributions to a traditional and Roth IRA are permitted at
    any age, provided the individual has earned income. Note that for
    traditional IRAs, this was increased from 70 Â½ on January 1st, 2020
    by the Secure Act.

2.  (**C**) In defined benefit plans, the employer bears responsibility
    for investment decisions and the risk of any investment losses. If
    losses cause the plan to fall short of the defined benefit promised,
    the employer must contribute more to make up the shortfall. In other
    types of retirement plans, employees bear the risk of investment
    losses. (If investments lose money, employees have less money in
    their retirement accounts.)

3.  (**C**) 401(k)s are profit-sharing plans with an important feature
    added. This is an elective deferral---a feature that gives plan
    participants the option of putting their own money in the plan, in
    addition to employer contributions. Employers can then choose to
    make profit-sharing contributions, matching contributions based on
    each worker's deferral, both types of contributions, or no
    contributions.

4.  (**B**) 457(b) plans are sponsored by state and local governments
    and tax-exempt 501(c) organizations. They should not be confused
    with 403(b) plans, which are sponsored by nonprofit, religious, and
    educational institutions. A 457(b) plan works much like a 401(k) in
    that it is participant-directed and funded in part by participant
    elective deferrals.

5.  (**D**) Non-qualified plans are not covered by ERISA. Unlike ERISA
    plans, they do not have automatic eligibility rules. Employers can
    include or exclude any employees they want. This makes these plans
    useful for rewarding highly paid, senior, or loyal employees.

6.  (**D**) A married couple can both contribute up to the dollar limit
    (plus any catch-ups) as long as their combined income equals or
    exceeds their combined annual contributions

7.  (**A**) A married couple can both contribute up to the dollar limit
    (plus any catch-ups) as long as their combined income equals or
    exceeds their combined annual contributions.

> In this case, they can divide \$6,500 in contributions in any way they
> wish among two IRAs, traditional or Roth. Since he has contributed
> \$6,000, she is limited to \$500.

8.  (**D**) Their income is too high for either to qualify for a Roth
    IRA contribution. (Only Roth IRAs have income limits on
    contributions.) However, both individuals can contribute to a
    traditional IRA as contributions to a traditional IRA are permitted
    at any age, provided the individual has earned income.

9.  (**B**) Withdrawals from IRAs are fully taxable at any age, unless
    they are withdrawals of after- tax contributions. Early withdrawals
    are those made before age 59 Â½ and they are subject to a 10%
    penalty---10% of the withdrawal---unless an exception applies.
    Payment of education expenses for the account owner, a spouse, her
    children, or her grandchildren is one of the exceptions.

> *Chapter 12:* Tax-Advantaged Accounts and Products

#### Unit Exam---Solutions (Continued) {#unit-examsolutions-continued-11 .unnumbered}

10. (**C**) Failure to take all of a required RMD subjects the
    traditional IRA account owner to

> a federal excise tax of 50% on the amount that should have been
> distributed. There are no extensions or excuses allowed, and
> distributing more in a subsequent year is not a remedy. The federal
> excise tax must be paid.

11. (**C**) Totally tax-free distributions from Roth IRAs are allowed if
    they meet two tests. First, they must be made after the five-year
    period that begins with the first tax year the Roth was set up. In
    this case, 2022 is the fifth year, and 2023 is after the fifth year.
    Second, they must be taken after age 59 Â½. He has already met this
    test. If the tests aren't met, withdrawals of contributions are
    tax-free and withdrawals of earnings are taxable and subject to a
    10% penalty, unless an exception applies.

12. (**D**) Annuities can begin paying income immediately or much later.
    In the first case, they are immediate annuities, and in the second
    case they are deferred annuities. The value of the invested amounts
    and/or interest can be guaranteed ( fixed) or can fluctuate with
    investment performance (variable). In an immediate fixed annuity,
    all future payments are guaranteed by an insurance company.

13. (**C**) Deferred annuities are of two types: fixed and variable.
    Fixed deferred annuities are allocated to the insurer's general
    account, guaranteed as to principal, and earn a competitive interest
    rate. Variable annuities are allocated to separate accounts and
    returns are linked to stock and bond funds. Some variable annuities
    also offer a fixed account choice that functions like a fixed
    deferred annuity.

14. (**A**) Separate accounts have much in common with other investment
    companies, including mutual funds. They typically include a variety
    of managed funds that have specific investment objectives and
    diversify holdings among many securities.

15. (**C**) To be tax-free and penalty-free, 529 plan withdrawals must
    not exceed the amount of the student's qualified education expenses
    paid in the same tax year. Tuition, fees, books, and technology
    assessments are qualified. Room and board is qualified (on or off
    campus) if the student is enrolled at least half time and the
    expense does not exceed the limit determined by each school.
    Transportation, medical expenses, and insurance costs are not
    qualified education expenses.

16. (**C**) This is a common dilemma with 529 plans, but there are
    options. She can keep the

> plan in her son's name, hoping that he changes his mind and one day
> attends school, or she can change the beneficiary to another child
> without penalty.

### FINRA Registration

> Securities regulations in the United States include both federal- and
> state-level regula- tions. The **Securities and Exchange Commission
> (SEC)** holds primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities
> laws and for regulating the securities industry, the nation's stock
> and options exchanges, and other electronic securities markets.
> Created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC was also given
> the power to regulate the companies whose securities are listed on
> exchanges and the broker-dealers that facilitate trading on these
> exchanges and on various OTC venues.
>
> Quasi-governmental organizations, or **self-regulatory organizations
> (SROs)**, also have authority over the securities industry. Certain
> regulatory authority is delegated by the SEC to FINRA and other SROs,
> such as the **Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)**. Many
> states also regulate the securities industry and broker-dealers under
> separate state securities laws, known as **blue sky laws**.
>
> This chapter will discuss the role played by SROs as well as the
> registration requirements of both broker-dealers and their employees,
> as well as investment advisory firms.

###### Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs)

> The SEC is a government agency that acts as the primary regulatory
> body in the securities industry. In this role, the SEC has the
> authority to delegate certain enforcement responsibil- ities to SROs,
> such as FINRA and the MSRB. These SROs are empowered by and
> accountable to the SEC for regulating certain aspects of the
> securities industry, such as enforcing secu- rities laws and
> supervising their members.

######### [FINRA]{.underline} 

> The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is the largest
> independent regulator of all securities firms doing business in the
> United States. Its chief role is to protect investors by maintaining
> fairness in the US capital markets. FINRA is involved in nearly every
> aspect of the securities business. Its roles include:

-   Registering and educating industry participants

-   Writing and enforcing rules, while enforcing the rules of the SEC

-   Examining firms for regulatory compliance

-   Administering dispute-resolution forums for investors and member
    firms

-   Performing market regulation for various exchanges, including Nasdaq

######### [MSRB]{.underline} 

> The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) was established in
> 1975 to govern the conduct of the participants in the municipal
> securities market. The rules of the MSRB build upon the general
> framework of federal securities laws, but add considerable detail that
> is tailored to the uniqueness of the municipal securities business.
>
> The MSRB creates rules and policies for firms and banks to regulate
> the underwriting, trad- ing, and selling of municipal securities. The
> MSRB, however, does not have the authority to regulate municipal
> securities issuers, only municipal securities firms and professionals.
> For example, New York City is not subject to the jurisdiction of the
> MSRB.
>
> While the MSRB has rulemaking authority, it does not have enforcement
> authority. It relies on other regulatory agencies to monitor the
> activities of municipal securities dealers and municipal advisors.
> These other regulators are granted the authority to discipline
> securities firms and individuals who violate rules.
>
> Specifically, FINRA enforces the rules of the MSRB for securities
> firms. Within banks, MSRB rules are enforced by the Federal Reserve
> Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC.
> The SEC has enforcement authority over municipal advisors in addition
> to all securities firms and banks.

> Registration

###### FINRA Registration of Broker-Dealers

> US securities laws require that all firms doing securities business as
> broker-dealers register with the SEC and become FINRA members. To
> initiate the process, the firm must submit to FINRA a New Member
> Agreement, Form BD, a detailed business plan, and the appropriate
> fees. Of course, this registration cannot be incomplete, inaccurate,
> or misleading in any way. Registration with the SEC is complete when
> FINRA approves the New Member Agreement.
>
> FINRA's New Member Agreement memorializes the contractual relationship
> between the firm and FINRA. It requires certifications that the firm
> will comply with various securities regulations, as well as maintain
> high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles
> of trade. It outlines the firm's permitted and prohibited business
> activities, based on its business plan and supervisory procedures. The
> firm may begin conducting business only when the New Member Agreement
> has been approved.
>
> After a firm's membership has been approved by FINRA, the firm must
> submit a Form U4 (discussed shortly), fingerprints, and fees for each
> associated person who is required to be registered under FINRA rules.
> Registration requirements apply to any person associated with a member
> firm who is engaged in the securities business of the firm. Note that
> indi- viduals may register with FINRA only if employed and sponsored
> by a FINRA member firm. The failure of any firm to register an
> employee could subject the firm to disciplinary action.
>
> For purposes of FINRA membership admission, the broker-dealer and its
> principals are only required to be registered in the state in which
> the firm's home office is located. However, under state blue sky laws,
> the broker-dealer, principals, and each registered representative must
> be registered in every state in which securities business will be
> conducted. It is not uncommon for firms, especially large ones, to
> register their reps to conduct business in all US states and
> territories (though a fee will be paid for each one).

###### Registration of Personnel

> An associated person of a broker-dealer is one whose activities are
> controlled directly or indirectly by a member firm. Not all associated
> persons require registration with FINRA and/or the MSRB. In addition,
> only duly employed personnel of a firm can be sponsored for
> registration. It would be a violation of FINRA and MSRB regulations to
> sponsor someone who is not employed by the firm. This is referred to
> as **parking a registration**.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Todd worked hard for 15 years selling securities as a registered
> representative and was a top performer at his firm. He now wants to
> retire, but keep his options open, so he asks the compliance
> department to maintain his registration even though he would not be
> working for the firm or performing.
>
> The compliance department must refuse this request to "park" Todd's
> license. FINRA licenses are only available for employees of the firm.

######### [Form U4]{.underline} 

> **Form U4** collects pertinent background information about candidates
> for registration. The form is used as a screening tool by firms and
> regulators for new or continued registration. It is one of the primary
> sources of information for a registered rep's **Central Registration
> Depository (CRD)** record with FINRA. It contains personal information
> about each broker or candidate, including:

-   Name

-   Social Security number

-   Five years of residential address history

-   10 years of employment history (the three most recent years must be
    verified by the firm)

-   Educational background

> Form U4 also requires applicants to self-report information relating
> to customer complaints, arbitration claims, regulatory proceedings,
> bankruptcies, certain criminal history, certain civil litigation, and
> liens and judgments. Applicants must answer all questions on the U4
> honestly, accurately, and completely, or face possible sanctions,
> including statutory disqual- ification from registration.

> FINRA Rule 2263 requires all registered representatives to sign a

> The representative gives up the right to sue and gives up the right to
> trial by jury except under special circumstances.
>
> In an arbitration proceeding, arbitrators, instead of judges or
> juries, decide whether wrong- doing has occurred and how to correct
> the situation or compensate the appropriate parties. The industry
> favors arbitration because it is less expensive and more efficient
> than court proceedings. Awards under arbitration are generally final

> Broker-dealers are required to maintain these records for at least
> three years after the time a person leaves a firm. Clerical employees

3.  ***Registered Principals***

> Every broker-dealer is also required to have **registered
> principals**. These individuals, who must pass the requisite
> qualification examinations, are generally officers and other man-
> agement personnel of the firm. Individuals are subject to registration
> as principals if they are involved in the day-to-day management of the
> firm's investment banking or securities business; in the supervision,
> solicitation, or conduct of business; or in the training of persons
> associated with a broker-dealer for any of these functions.
>
> Under most circumstances, a firm is required to have a minimum of two
> principals.

4.  ***Persons Exempt from Registration***

> Certain associated persons of a firm are not required to register with
> FINRA or the MSRB. These persons include employees who perform only
> clerical or administrative duties.
>
> Note that individuals that engage in only municipal securities
> business register with the MSRB rather than FINRA.

######### [Amended Form U4]{.underline} 

> Under FINRA rules, when a broker-dealer hires a representative it must
> ensure that the infor- mation on the representative's Form U4 is
> updated and kept current in the CRD system. The firm must update that
> information whenever significant changes or events occur, such as:

-   Regulatory actions against the registered representative

> *Chapter 13*

######## FINRA {#finra-9 .unnumbered}

> Registration

-   Certain customer complaints against the registered representative

-   Settlements involving the registered representative

-   Certain criminal charges and convictions of the registered
    representative

-   Liens, bankruptcy filings, or a compromise with creditors

> Normally, updates (e.g., a new address) must be filed within 30
> calendar days of the event. However, a reportable event involving
> statutory disqualification (often the result of a crim- inal
> conviction, discussed later) must be disclosed to CRD within 10
> calendar days.

######### [Form U5]{.underline} 

> Firms are required to notify FINRA of the termination of a registered
> person by filing a **Form U5** notice that includes the reason for
> termination. Firms must notify FINRA within 30 calendar days of an
> individual's termination.
>
> Even persons who are no longer registered are subject to the
> jurisdiction of regulators for at least two years after their
> registration has been terminated. They must ensure that address
> information is continually updated during this time and may be
> required to provide infor- mation about their activities while
> associated with the firm.
>
> For example, if a firm finds out that a former registered rep was in
> violation of a number of securities industry regulations, the firm
> must update the former employee's U5, even though the person has since
> left the firm.
>
> ***[13.3.5.1 Examination Requalification Requirements]{.underline}***
>
> Registrations remain effective while individuals are active in the
> securities business. If a registered person leaves the employing firm
> and does not re-associate with another member firm within two years,
> the person would be required to retake their qualification exams when
> returning to the industry. Note that the SIE would not expire for four
> years. For example, an individual who is out of the industry for three
> years would need to retake the appropriate Series exam, but not the
> SIE. Also, if a registration is revoked for regulatory reasons, exam-
> inations must be passed again.

######### [Statutory Disqualification]{.underline} 

> Several events can either prevent a person or firm from becoming
> registered or result in the loss of registration. Prevention or loss
> of registration from these events is known as **statu- tory
> disqualification**, which results from any of the following:

-   Felony convictions within the last 10 years

-   Misdemeanors involving securities, investments, fraud, extortion,
    bribery, or other unethical activities within the last 10 years

-   Temporary and permanent injunctions issued at any time by a court
    involving a broad range of unlawful investment activities

-   Expulsion and/or suspension from membership in an SRO or another
    regulator

-   Findings that a broker-dealer or person has made false statements in
    applications or reports made to, or in proceedings before, SROs

-   Involvement in arbitration or civil litigation that concludes with
    findings of sales practice violations

-   Findings by the SEC or an SRO that a person willfully violated
    federal securities laws

> FINRA Rule 4530 requires firms to promptly update FINRA if any of the
> above activities occur and to file with FINRA copies of any criminal
> action, civil complaints, and arbitration claims.
>
> ***13.3.7.1 Eligibility Proceedings***
>
> Once aware of a statutory disqualifying event, a firm is obligated to
> report the event to FINRA within 10 days on an amended Form U4. In the
> case of a disqualified person, the firm must either file a Form U5 if
> it wishes to terminate the individual's association, or request a
> waiver from ineligibility if it wishes to sponsor the association of
> the disqualified person.
>
> The waiver request must include information about the terms and
> conditions of the pro- posed employment, with emphasis on the proposed
> supervision to be accorded the disqual- ified person. If a waiver is
> granted, the firm typically must ensure active and comprehensive
> supervision of that associated person.

> types of products and services offered, any customer complaints and
> legal or regulatory actions facing the firm, and the performance of
> its registered persons in the Regulatory Element.
>
> After completing its needs analysis, the firm must create a written
> training plan that describes in detail how the Firm Element will be
> conducted for the upcoming year. The needs analysis and the training
> plan must be completed by the end of each calendar or fiscal year.
>
> The content of the firm's training plan is not defined or approved by
> FINRA or other regu- lators. The program material must be appropriate

> If newly hired representatives have already completed the Firm Element
> with another firm, they may not be required to complete the Firm

###### State Blue Sky Laws

> As mentioned, each state also regulates the securities industry under
> its **blue sky laws**. Kansas was the first state to adopt such a law,
> in 1911, after its banking commissioner cru- saded against
> "speculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of
> blue sky." The term was echoed in a landmark US Supreme Court opinion
> written by Justice Joseph McKenna in 1917, and has been used ever
> since.
>
> *Chapter 13*

######## FINRA {#finra-14 .unnumbered}

> Registration
>
> Blue sky laws are enforced by each state's securities department or
> commission and led by the state's securities commissioner. The primary
> role of state securities regulators is to
>
> 1\) protect consumers who purchase securities or investment advice and
> 2) supervise the issuers and intermediaries who offer and sell
> securities to the public. As a general matter, both securities and
> securities firms, such as broker-dealers, investment advisers, and
> their professionals, must register at the state level.

###### Investment Advisers

> While this chapter has focused primarily on the requirements of
> broker-dealers and their employees, candidates should also be familiar
> with the registration requirements of invest- ment advisers.
>
> The **Investment Advisers Act of 1940** defines an **investment
> adviser (IA)** as any person or firm that is engaged in the business
> of providing advice regarding securities *for compensa- tion*.
> Typically, the fee is a percentage of the assets under management,
> although it also may be hourly, flat, or per-service. Because
> investment advisers are in the business of providing advice to
> customers, they have a fiduciary responsibility to act in the best
> interests of their clients.
>
> Most investment advisers manage individual client portfolios, mutual
> funds, or hedge funds. Financial planners who recommend securities and
> charge fees are also investment advis- ers. However, registered
> representatives of a broker-dealer who execute trades and receive
> commissions are generally not advisers.
>
> Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, most investment advisers
> are required to regis- ter---i.e., become **registered investment
> advisers (RIAs)**. The purpose of registration is to provide
> prospective investors clear disclosures about the adviser's
> background, business, methods, and fee structure. In addition,
> registration allows regulators to monitor this infor- mation, audit
> the adviser's practice, and hold advisers accountable.
>
> Investment advisers differ from broker-dealers in that IAs charge for
> the *advice* that is being provided whereas broker-dealers charge for
> transactions that are executed. However, some broker-dealers do offer
> **wrap accounts**, which provide a group of services, including
> invest- ment advice and brokerage services, for a single fee. In this
> scenario, because broker-dealers are charging for advice, a
> broker-dealer would need to dually register as both an investment
> adviser and a broker-dealer.

######### Investment Adviser Registration

> Most investment advisers are required to register with *either* the
> SEC or with the securities commissions of the states in which they
> operate.
>
> Generally, larger advisers, which are defined as those with over \$100
> million in assets under management, must register with the SEC. In
> contrast, smaller advisers, those with less than
>
> \$100 million in assets, must directly register in each state that
> they operate in rather than the SEC.
>
> Assuming SEC registration is required, a firm registers with the SEC
> by filing **Form ADV**.
>
> The SEC does not require separate registration of individuals who work
> under an SEC- registered investment adviser delivering investment
> advice and services to individual cli- ents. However, most states
> require registration of such individuals as **investment adviser
> representatives (IARs)**. An IAR is generally defined by states as a
> person affiliated with a registered investment adviser who:

-   Provides advice or recommendations regarding securities

-   Manages portfolios for clients for a fee

-   Solicits or negotiates investment advisory services

-   Supervises other investment adviser representatives

> Most states require IAR registration for any individual working for a
> registered investment adviser who meets one or more of these criteria,
> regardless of whether the investment adviser itself is registered with
> the state or the SEC. Put differently, investment adviser rep-
> resentatives must register at the state level regardless of whom they
> work for.

######### Exemptions from Investment Adviser Registration

-   Lawyers, accountants, engineers, and teachers

-   Banks and bank holding companies

-   Bona fide publishers of newspapers, magazines, and
    general-circulation business or financial publications (e.g., *Wall

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-12 .unnumbered}

1.  (**C**) The SEC, along with self-regulatory organizations like
    FINRA, can impose fines, revoke registrations, and censure firms,
    but they are not empowered to bring criminal charges. They must
    refer criminal matters to the US Department of Justice or state law
    enforcement.

2.  (**C**) US securities law empowers the SEC as the primary regulatory
    body for the US securities industry. The SEC, in turn, delegates
    certain responsibilities to self-regulatory organizations (SROs)
    such as FINRA. The SROs are accountable to the SEC.

3.  (**A**) The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) is the
    self-regulatory organization (SRO) charged with regulation of the
    municipal securities market. It has rulemaking but not enforcement
    authority. It regulates municipal securities firms and professionals
    but not municipal bond *issuers*.

4.  (**C**) Form U4 requires 10 years of employment history. Firms must
    independently verify the most recent three years.

5.  (**D**) The U4 requires reps to list the address of their office of
    employment. Reps must also check a box if their Office of Employment
    is a private residence. It is the rep's responsibility to update his
    U4 with *all* changes and amended information. The amendment must be
    submitted within 30 days of any change.

6.  (**A**) The pre-dispute arbitration clause requires both parties to
    submit all disputes for arbitration except for those involving
    discrimination and sexual harassment. In these two areas, disputes
    will only go to arbitration if both parties agree.

7.  (**D**) Employees do not need to be fingerprinted if they are not
    engaged in securities sales, do not handle money or securities, and
    are not involved in keeping original books and records. In other
    words, employees with purely secretarial or administrative duties
    (outside those listed above) do not need fingerprints.

8.  (**C**) After the third successive failed try at the same exam, the
    applicant must wait at least 180 days before retaking the exam.
    After the first two fails, there is a mandatory waiting period of 30
    days before the exam can be taken again.

9.  (**A**) The SIE Exam allows individuals to pass the first hurdle
    toward becoming a registered person without committing to entering
    the industry or joining a specific firm--- individuals need not be
    sponsored by a FINRA member to take the exam.

10. (**C**) Firms are required to notify FINRA of *any* termination of a
    registered person by filing a Form U5 within 30 calendar days of
    termination.

11. (**C**) FINRA makes the information filed on Form U4 publicly
    available through its BrokerCheck program. Each firm must notify
    customers at least annually about the existence of BrokerCheck and
    of its website address and phone number. BrokerCheck is the most
    authoritative source of background check information for customers
    shopping for a new rep.

#### Unit Exam---Solutions (Continued) {#unit-examsolutions-continued-12 .unnumbered}

12. (**C**) Investment advisers are persons or firms that provide
    securities-related advice in the normal course of business for a
    fee. Because advisers are in the process of providing advice, they
    have a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interest of their
    clients. Advisers with assets under management in excess of \$100
    million register with the SEC, while smaller advisers register at
    the state level. Unlike IA advise, the advice broker- dealers
    provide is incidental, so BDs instead charge customers for executing
    transactions.

13. (**B**) The first Regulatory Element deadline for a newly registered
    person is 120 days after the second anniversary of the registration
    date. If this deadline isn't met, the person automatically becomes
    CE inactive. That means her license is administratively terminated
    and she cannot engage in securities-related activities.

14. (**A**) Firm Element CE must be completed by a registered rep
    annually. Each firm must track compliance, and failure to meet the
    annual requirement can result in disciplinary action by the firm or
    FINRA. However, there is no inactive CE status for failure to
    complete Firm Element CE.

15. (**D**) Clarence is an investment adviser representative (IAR).
    Because he works under a registered investment adviser (RIA),
    probably his securities firm, he is not required to be an RIA
    himself. However, since he provides investment advice and handles
    fee- based accounts with discretion, he must register as an IAR, if
    his state requires it. All IAR registration is through the
    individual states, not the SEC.

16. (**A**) Large advisers and financial planners who provide investment
    advice for a fee are required to register with the SEC. A large
    adviser is defined as one with more than

> \$100 million in assets under management. Smaller advisers generally
> register with their state securities commission. Banks, as well as
> family offices with only one family client, are exempt from SEC
> registration.

### Business Conduct Rules

> also for staying abreast of changes in current legislation,
> regulation, and policy.
>
> Registrants who violate industry rules and regulations are subject to
> disciplinary action, including censures, fines, suspension, or
> permanent loss of registration.

-   **Outside business activity (OBA)**---A second job away from the
    broker-dealer of a registered representative, which requires prior
    notification to the firm

-   **Private securities transaction**---Occurs when a registered
    representative conducts securities-related business away from their

###### High Standards of Business

> FINRA Rules 2010 and 2020 as well as MSRB Rules G-2 and G-17 all
> require firms and their representatives to conduct themselves and
> their activities with high and equitable stan- dards to ensure
> fairness within the capital markets. These rules are paramount to the
> way in which broker-dealers and their employees must act within the
> industry, helping to protect customers against any manipulative or
> deceptive actions.

###### Insider Trading

> Securities laws broadly prohibit fraudulent activities of any kind in
> connection with the offer, purchase, or sale of securities. These
> provisions are the basis for many types of disciplinary actions,
> including actions against **insider trading**.
>
> An **insider** is defined as any person who has knowledge of or access
> to meaningful nonpub- lic information about a company. Examples of
> insiders include corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who
> own more than 10% of a company's outstanding shares. However, a
> violation of insider trading rules is not limited to just these
> persons; it extends to anyone who has access to material nonpublic
> information and purchases or sells securities based on this knowledge.
> For example, if a corporate insider tips a friend about nonpublic
> information
>
> that is likely to have an effect on the company's share price, the
> friend is also in violation if a trade is made on the basis of this
> information. Both the **tipper** and the **tippee** have potential
> liability.
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules
>
> The SEC will pay a reward to those who provide information relating to
> potential insider trading violations. In addition, any investor who is
> financially impacted by insider trading activities is permitted to
> bring suit against that investor to recover the cost of his
> investment.
>
> The **misappropriation theory** broadens liability for insider trading
> violations. It states that persons who misappropriate (steal)
> information from their employers and trade on that information in any
> stock, not just their employers' stock, are guilty of insider trading
> violations. An example of this situation is a journalist who is aware
> of material nonpublic information about a potential takeover because
> of an investigation they are conducting. Trading on this information
> is illegal.

######### Duty of Trust

> Another scenario in which individuals may have liability for insider
> trading is in connection with a breach of a **duty of trust**. Under
> SEC Rule 10b5-2, a duty of trust or confidence applies when two people
> have a history of sharing sensitive information in confidence and the
> recip- ient of the information should reasonably understand that the
> information should be kept confidential. This allows an individual to
> avoid liability for insider trading if the recipient **should have
> known** that nonpublic information was being shared.
>
> For example, an individual who steals a deal file from a colleague's
> desk and trades on the information would be expected to know that the
> information was nonpublic, even though no one explicitly told him so.

######### Penalties for Insider Trading

> Penalties for insider trading violations originate in the '33 Act and
> '34 Act under anti-fraud provisions against "manipulative or
> deceptive" devices.
>
> Legislation has intensified these penalties over the years,
> particularly the **Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement
> Act of 1988**. The '34 Act provides for both civil and criminal
> penalties for insider trading and securities fraud.
>
> ***[14.2.2.1 Civil Penalties]{.underline}***
>
> Civil penalties are limited to a dollar amount equal to three times
> the profit gained or loss avoided by illegal insider trades. This is
> also referred to as **treble damages**. Supervisors who should have
> known about or could have prevented the illegal activity can also be
> subject to treble damages.
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules
>
> ***14.2.2.2 Criminal Penalties***
>
> Criminal penalties for willful violations are limited to \$5 million
> in fines and up to 20 years in prison. The cap on fines increases to
> \$25 million for corporations.

######### [Policies and Procedures for Information Barriers]{.underline} 

> The Insider Trading Act also requires firms to impose supervisory
> procedures to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information by
> employee and proprietary accounts. To comply with these requirements,
> firms must establish **information barriers** that prevent the free
> flow of material, nonpublic information. In addition to written
> procedures, physical separation is required between departments that
> regularly receive inside information and a firm's trading desk.
>
> Firms that conduct investment banking, research, or arbitrage
> activities must maintain some form of restricted and watch lists.
> Typically, a **restricted list** is a list of securities in which
> proprietary, employee, and certain solicited customer transactions are
> restricted or prohibited. A **watch list** is a current list of
> securities that generally do not carry trading restrictions, but the
> trading of which is subject to close scrutiny by the firm's compliance
> department. The restricted list is distributed periodically throughout
> the broker-dealer to make employees aware of those securities that the
> firm is restricted or prohibited from recommending and/or trading.
> Both lists should include:

-   The date and time the security was added to or deleted from the
    > list, and

-   The name of a contact person who could answer questions about the
    > addition or deletion

    1.  ***Proprietary and Employee Trading Reviews***

> Firms are required to establish procedures to review transactions that
> may constitute insider trading. These procedures must provide for
> review of securities transactions for:

-   The firm

-   Employees of the firm, and

-   Family members of the firm's employees

> For any suspicious transactions, the firm must promptly conduct an
> internal investigation to determine whether there were violations.

###### Anti-Money Laundering Regulation

> **Money laundering** is the process of making illicit funds obtained
> from criminal activity appear legal.
>
> The US Treasury Department identifies three phases of money
> laundering:

-   **Placement** is the process of depositing illegal funds into
    financial institutions. This is the part of the process that is most
    easily detected.

-   **Layering** is when money is transferred through complex financial
    transactions (such as wire transfers) to separate the funds from
    their illegal origins.

-   Through **integration**, the illegal funds are mixed with legitimate
    funds.

> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules
>
> FINRA and MSRB rules, as well as federal laws, subject financial
> institutions to protect against money laundering and other financial
> crimes. The **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)**, ini- tially adopted in 1970,
> established the basic framework for **anti-money laundering (AML)
> regulations**. Among other things, it authorizes the US Treasury to
> issue regulations requiring financial firms to keep records and file
> reports of certain financial transactions. The **Financial Crimes
> Enforcement Network (FinCEN)**, a bureau within the Treasury
> Department, is the administrator of the BSA.
>
> FinCEN requires the submission of a number of documents by
> broker-dealers and other financial institutions in its efforts to
> prevent money laundering.

######### [Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)]{.underline} 

> A **currency transaction report (CTR)** must be filed whenever a
> financial institution receives a cash deposit in excess of \$10,000 in
> a single business day from a single customer, whether it be in one
> transaction or in a combination of transactions. CTRs are filed with
> FinCEN within 15 days of the cash deposit(s). Separate regulations
> also require that busi- nesses report cash payments of more than
> \$10,000 to the IRS.
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules

######### [Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)]{.underline} 

> **Suspicious activity reports (SARs)** must be filed by broker-dealers
> if customers' actions indicate that they may be engaging in money
> laundering activities or otherwise violating federal laws. The
> following are examples of suspicious activities:

-   A request to shred account information

-   Frequent wire transfers between seemingly unrelated accounts

-   Indifference to churning or higher-than-normal fees

-   Deposits just under the \$10,000 limit that would trigger a CTR
    filing (e.g., a \$9,900 deposit)

> SARs are filed with FinCEN within 30 days of the discovery of the
> suspicious activity. A regis- tered rep is prohibited from disclosing
> to a customer that they have filed a SAR for activities by the
> customer.

######### [The USA PATRIOT Act]{.underline} 

> The **USA PATRIOT Act**, enacted by Congress in 2001 in response to
> the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, amended and strengthened
> the BSA. It imposed a number of new AML obligations directly on
> broker-dealers, including:

-   The development of an **AML compliance program** and a **customer
    > identification program (CIP)**

-   Prohibitions on transactions with persons on the **Specially
    > Designated Nationals (SDN) list** compiled by the **Office of
    > Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)**, which is part of the US Treasury
    > Department. Any transactions with someone on this list must be
    > blocked, and the attempt must be reported to OFAC within 10 days.

-   Mandatory information-sharing in response to requests by federal law
    > enforcement

1.  (**C**) For a case for insider trading to be made, the information
    used to trade or benefit in the market must be both material
    (meaningful and market-moving) and nonpublic--- not yet publicly
    known or widely released. If the information meets these tests, it
    may not matter much who was the source, how it was obtained, or
    whether or not it is true.

2.  (**C**) The civil penalty is up to treble damages---three times the
    profit gained or loss avoided. By statute, the criminal penalty is a
    maximum of 20 years in prison.

3.  (**B**) Broker-dealers must take specific compliance actions to
    deter insider trading. These actions include setting up 1)
    information barriers to prevent dissemination of material, nonpublic
    information; 2) watch lists to designate specific securities for
    compliance scrutiny; and 3) restricted lists. When securities are
    put on restricted lists, they are subject to restrictions or
    prohibitions for purposes of proprietary, employee, and/or solicited
    customer transactions.

4.  (**A**) Money launderers are notorious for layering the illegal cash
    they receive by routing it through mainstream financial channels and
    accounts, often in amounts just below reporting limits. Anti-money
    laundering regulations are designed to detect illegal layering
    activity by *knowing the customer* and filing currency transaction
    reports (CTRs) and suspicious activity reports (SARs).

5.  (**D**) CTRs must be filed within 15 days of a cash deposit in
    excess of \$10,000 by a single customer in a single day. They are
    filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a
    bureau of the US Treasury.

6.  (**B**) None of these cash deposits are above the \$10,000 daily
    limit that triggers a cash transaction report (CTR). However, this
    looks suspiciously like a textbook case of layering done to avoid
    anti-money laundering reporting rules. A suspicious activity report
    (SAR) should be filed with FinCEN within 30 days of the activity
    being discovered. The firm's internal systems should be designed to
    discover the layering pattern by the third or fourth deposit, if not
    sooner. Reps should also be vigilant.

7.  (**B**) Filing a suspicious activity report (SAR) is not proof of
    guilt. It sets in motion procedures designed to detect and
    potentially prosecute money laundering and related crimes. Nate is
    allowed to tell the client the account has been closed. However, he
    is prohibited from telling the client a SAR has been filed.

8.  (**A**) The main required components are: employee training, SAR
    policies and procedures, independent testing, written AML
    documentation approved by a senior manager, and designation of an
    AML compliance officer. Distribution of AML literature to clients is
    optional.

> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules

######  Other Business Conduct Rules

> Firms and their employees must adhere to a number of important conduct
> rules. These procedures, and all of the rules created, interpreted,
> and enforced by securities industry regulators, are critical to the
> primary objective of investor protection and fair dealing.

######### Transactions with Other Members

> FINRA Rule 3210 establishes requirements that must be followed when an
> associated person opens or maintains a trading account with another
> broker-dealer. The concern is that these persons may engage in
> improper trading practices away from the supervision of their firms.
>
> The rule requires that the registered rep that opens an account with
> another firm:

-   Obtain prior written consent from their employer before opening an
    > account, and

-   Notify the opening firm of their association with the employing
    > member prior to opening the account

> ***Example***
>
> Matthew is a registered representative employed at Firm XYZ. He wants
> to open an out- side brokerage account at Firm ABC. To do so, he must
> receive permission of Firm XYZ and let Firm ABC know of his employment
> status with XYZ prior to account opening.
>
> Additionally, prior written consent is also required for the accounts
> of immediate family members, including spouses and children. However,
> this requirement is waived if the asso- ciated person can demonstrate
> that no financial benefit or control exists.
>
> If a registered representative joins a new firm, to maintain
> securities accounts open at other financial institutions, written
> consent from the new employer must be obtained within 30 calendar days
> of association with the new firm.
>
> Finally, the opening firm---the firm opening the account---must send
> duplicate copies of account statements and trade confirmations upon
> written request from the employer.
>
> These rules do not apply to brokerage accounts solely containing
> investments in mutual funds, UITs, or variable annuities.

######### Payments to Unregistered Persons

> According to FINRA Rule 2040, broker-dealers and their registered
> representatives are not permitted to pay or compensate unregistered
> persons in connection with securities trans- actions or business. For
> example, a registered representative at a brokerage firm is not per-
> mitted to pay the firm's unregistered receptionist a 2% share of
> commissions on business referred by the receptionist. Likewise, a firm
> may not rebate or reduce the fees charged to a particular client based
> on new business the client directs to the firm.
>
> Registered representatives may split commissions only with other
> registered representatives of the same firm or those of affiliated
> firms.

######### Continuing Commissions

> FINRA Rule 2040 allows retired registered reps to receive commissions
> from customers' accounts that were opened prior to their retirement. A
> contract between the broker-dealer and the retiring rep must explain
> the arrangement and prohibit the retiree from soliciting new business
> or servicing accounts to generate additional business. To receive
> these com- missions, the retiring rep must *be out of* the securities
> industry; that is, a rep that retired but then re-joined would not be
> able to continue receiving these commissions.
>
> ***Example***
>
> After a long and successful career as a registered rep, Ray is ready
> to retire. Many of his clients have purchased securities products that
> pay trailing commissions, fees Ray earns each year for having sold the
> products to his clients. To continue earning these fees, Ray must sign
> a contract, such as a continuing commissions letter, while registered,
> which will allow him and his estate to continue to receive these
> payments after he retires. If Ray were to re-associate with any other
> broker-dealer, he would lose the ability to receive these commissions.

######### Outside Business Activities (OBAs)

> FINRA Rule 3270 requires that individuals employed by broker-dealers
> notify their firms of any business activities that are outside the
> scope of their relationship with the firm. This applies to any
> situation where the associated person may be employed by or accept
> com- pensation from any entity outside the firm.
>
> Many associated persons fail to recognize an **outside business
> activity (OBA)** and inad- vertently violate this rule. To put it
> simply, if a rep receives money for doing something away from their
> firm, it is likely an outside business activity that requires
> disclosure.
>
> Examples of outside activities include consulting work on the side,
> preparing tax returns for clients for a fee, selling a product which
> is not a security, or something as benign as a bartending job for some
> additional income.
>
> That said, compensation is not the only determiner of whether an event
> is reportable. For example, a registered rep starts a business and
> does not pay themselves a salary. This may be considered an outside
> business activity under this FINRA rule.
>
> The rule does not prohibit engagement in outside business activities.
> It simply requires that associated persons provide their firms with
> written notice that they are involved in such activities. Such
> involvement requires a prompt update to an associated person's Form
> U4.
>
> However, under this rule, notification is not required for any passive
> investment activity. For example, being a limited partner in a real
> estate deal would not require notification.

> Broker-dealers may choose to have policies that are more stringent
> than FINRA's. In the case of an OBA, a broker-dealer could choose to
> require permission. However, the exam will test knowledge of the FINRA
> rule.

######### [Private Securities Transactions]{.underline} 

> **Private securities transactions** are transactions in securities
> that have not been approved for sale by the firm. Each broker-dealer
> is required to maintain an approved product list, and must perform due
> diligence on new products to ensure they are suitable for some
> customers before making them available for sale. Participating in
> private securities transactions is also known as **selling away**.
>
> For example, a close friend of a rep might ask her to help raise
> capital for a start-up by con- tacting the firm's clients on evenings
> and weekends. This is selling away.
>
> FINRA Rule 3280 states that an associated person may not participate
> in any private secu- rities transactions without:

-   Providing detailed notice of the proposed transaction, the role the
    person is to play, and whether or not compensation will be paid, and

-   Receiving written approval from their firm to participate

> If the firm does not approve a person's participation in the private
> securities transaction, the person cannot participate in the
> transaction in any manner, directly or indirectly.
>
> If the rep is not receiving compensation for the private securities
> transaction, only notice,
>
> not permission, is required. However, any type of compensation,
> including non-cash com- pensation, such as deal flow, triggers the
> permission requirement.
>
> If the firm approves a person's participation in a private securities
> transaction for compensa- tion, the transaction must be recorded on
> the firm's books and records. It must be supervised as if it were part
> of the firm's business.
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules

######### Guarantees Against Loss

> In dealing with customers in securities transactions, registered
> representatives are obli- gated to disclose all material information
> about a security. Representatives cannot present only the positive
> side of an investment and cannot offer to buy back, indemnify, or make
> a customer whole if an investment does not provide a positive return.
> FINRA Rule 2150 and MSRB Rule G-25 strictly prohibit a **guarantee
> against loss** in connection with any securities transaction or any
> customer account by a broker-dealer or representative.
>
> This does not preclude a firm from reimbursements or awards associated
> with settlements or with the correction of an error. In addition,
> repurchase agreements and put features on securities are not
> considered guarantees against loss and therefore are not prohibited.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Naomi just landed a new client, Terri, who has expressed some concern
> about losing money in the markets. Naomi suggests a conservative
> portfolio, but then further indi- cates, off the record, that if the
> account loses money, she will refund her fees as a means to reimburse
> her, in part, for any losses in the account.
>
> This is a prohibited guarantee against loss. Naomi cannot make a
> promise of this nature to a client. Likewise, a promise to purchase
> the securities back from Terri if they decline in value would
> constitute a violation.

######### Gifts and Gratuities

> FINRA Rule 3220 and MSRB Rule G-20 places limits on **gifts and
> gratuities** that are given by a firm or its associated persons to
> employees or representatives of other firms. The limit on these gifts
> is \$100 per individual per year. This \$100 limit is per calendar
> year, unless the firm calculates the year differently (e.g., fiscal
> year) in its written supervisory procedures.
>
> This limit does not apply to contracts for employment or compensation
> for services rendered as long as there is a written agreement of
> employment and records are maintained for all payments and agreements
> of this nature.
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules
>
> This rule also does not apply to entertainment expenses, such as meals
> or sporting events, provided the registered representative attends the
> event and that the event is not so egre- gious as to create the
> appearance of impropriety. For example, taking a client to dinner at a
> local restaurant or to a local sporting event would not be a
> violation.

######### [Sharing in Customer Accounts]{.underline} 

> FINRA Rule 2150 specifies the regulations regarding **sharing in
> customer accounts**. Specifically, except under certain circumstances,
> broker-dealers and representatives cannot share in the profits or
> losses, or receive compensation based on a share of profits or losses,
> in customers' accounts.
>
> This activity is only permitted if:

-   The associated person obtains written authorization from the firm
    > prior to engaging in the sharing arrangement

-   The associated person or broker-dealer obtains prior written
    > authorization from the customer, and

-   The sharing is in direct proportion to each person's financial
    > contributions to such an account (e.g., if the rep contributes
    > only 10% of the cash in the account, he can only share in 10% of
    > the profits)

> Accounts with immediate family members are not subject to the
> "proportionate share" stip- ulations. Immediate family for this rule
> includes parents, mother- or father-in-law, spouse, children, or any
> relative to whose support the associated person contributes directly
> or indirectly.
>
> MSRB Rule G-25 is similar to the FINRA rule, except that it only
> allows registered represen- tatives, not municipal firms themselves,
> to open joint investment accounts with customers.
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules

######### [Borrowing from or Lending to Members]{.underline} 

> FINRA Rule 3240 regulates registered reps **borrowing from and lending
> to customers**. Borrowing and lending activity is permitted, if the
> firm's procedures allow for it, in the fol- lowing circumstances:

-   With immediate family members, which, for this, rule includes
    parents, in-laws, spouses, children, grandparents, grandchildren,
    cousins, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and any other person whom
    the registered person supports, directly or indirectly, to a
    material extent

-   With financial institutions regularly engaged in this activity
    (i.e., banks)

-   Based on a personal or business relationship outside the
    broker/customer relationship

> A firm's procedures must address borrowing and lending activity, and
> if allowed, written pre-approval is required unless the loan has been
> made with standard commercial terms available to the general public or
> the borrowing or lending involves immediate family members.
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules
>
> ***Knopman Note:***
>
> **Registered reps are generally prohibited from personally lending
> money to clients, but there are some exceptions to the rule:**
>
> **No notice or permission required if**

-   Client is a family member, or

-   Client is a bank and loan is on market terms

> **Firm permission required if**

-   Loan is based on an outside business or personal relationship (i.e.,
    the loan is not based on the brokerage account), or

-   Client is a registered person at the same firm

> **Note: It would be prohibited for a registered rep to accept a
> discounted rate on a loan from a bank that is a client due to their
> relationship with the bank. However, a rep may borrow from a bank that
> is not their client at a favorable rate.**

######### [Customer Complaints]{.underline} 

> Under FINRA Rule 4513, **customer complaints** are written statements
> from a customer or any person acting on behalf of a customer that
> allege a grievance involving the activities of an associated person or
> a broker-dealer in connection with a securities transaction.
>
> All written customer complaints must be forwarded to a principal, and
> firms are required to keep a record of both the complaint and action
> taken by the firm, if any.

1.  ***Reporting of Complaints and Other Proceedings***

> FINRA Rule 4530 subjects firms to detailed reporting requirements
> based on the nature and consequences of a customer complaint. They
> must submit a report to FINRA by the 15th day of the month following
> the calendar quarter in which customer complaints have been received.

2.  ***MSRB Investor Brochure***

> MSRB Rule G-10 requires firms that deal with municipal securities to
> keep investors edu- cated about the safeguards and resources available
> to them. Specifically, each year firms are required to provide
> investors with the following items in writing:

-   A statement that they are registered with the SEC and MSRB

-   The website address of the MSRB, and

-   A notification of the availability of an investor brochure on the
    MSRB's website, which describes the protections available under MSRB
    rules and how to file a complaint with the appropriate regulatory
    authority

> The **investor brochure** summarizes key principles of the MSRB's
> customer protection rules and provides a link to the MSRB rulebook,
> which investors may review or download. This brochure also provides
> direction on how to attempt dispute resolution or initiate a formal
> regulatory proceeding.

> Similar to FINRA rules, if the firm does receive a written complaint
> from a customer, the complaint must be forwarded to a supervisor.
> Municipal securities firms must maintain records of customer
> complaints for at least six years.

######### Use of Information Obtained in a Fiduciary Capacity

> Securities firms and their representatives are often exposed to
> confidential, nonpublic infor- mation regarding the ownership of
> securities in the course of their business. FINRA Rule 2060 is
> concerned with the protection of this information.
>
> Specifically, the rule states that when a firm acts in a fiduciary or
> an agency capacity for another entity, it cannot use information it
> learned while in this capacity for the purpose of soliciting business,
> or in any other situation where it could experience financial gain,
> with- out first gaining consent from the issuer. The rule applies if
> the firm is acting as a trustee, paying agent, or transfer agent on
> behalf of another client.
>
> ***Example***
>
> If a bank acts as a trustee for a bond issuer, the bank cannot use any
> information learned about the bondholders for its personal gain,
> unless the issuer gives it permission to do so.

######### Conflicts of Interest

> **Conflicts of interest** occur often in the securities industry and
> can result in unfair treat- ment to customers if they're not properly
> managed. FINRA and the MSRB have rules in place to prohibit
> manipulation or deception by requiring disclosure of conflicts. When
> effecting transactions with or for a customer for which a conflict
> exists, the broker-dealer must make verbal disclosure of the conflict
> prior to the trade, and written disclosure of the conflict must appear
> on the trade confirmation. Failure to disclose a conflict is a
> violation.
>
> One example of a potential conflict defined by FINRA Rule 2269 is
> compensation practices that influence reps to make product
> recommendations to customers that do not fully align with suitability.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Stanley, a registered rep, recommends a mutual fund to his customer.
> If the sale goes through, Stanley will receive an additional sales
> commission from the mutual fund. This is a conflict and must be
> disclosed to the customer.
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules
>
> Furthermore, FINRA Rule 2262, requires firms and representatives to
> disclose any **control relationship** to investors. A control
> relationship occurs when the firm selling the security is controlled
> by, controls, or is under common control with the issuer.
>
> ***Example***
>
> Rena is a customer interested in purchasing stock of a company in the
> financial sector. She contacts Alan, her registered rep at
> Broker-Dealer ABC. Alan recommends that Rena purchase shares of ABC's
> stock. This is a conflict, as an ABC rep is trying to sell ABC stock
> to Rena. This sale is permitted but must be disclosed verbally prior
> to the trade and in writing on the trade confirmation.
>
> Although FINRA rules do not require elimination of all conflicts of
> interest (this is not fea- sible), firms are required to have
> procedures to help them identify, mitigate, and manage conflicts so
> that they do not result in unethical decision-making or unfair
> treatment of customers.

######### [Political Contributions]{.underline} 

> One particular conflict that has arisen in the past within the
> municipal securities industry is **pay-to-play**. This is the practice
> of municipal firms and their representatives making political
> contributions to issuers and other persons in exchange for receiving
> municipal underwriting and advisory business opportunities. MSRB Rule
> G-37 places strict restrictions on these contributions.
>
> The entities subject to this rule are municipal firms, political
> action committees (PACs) con- trolled by a municipal securities firm,
> or other **municipal finance professionals (MFPs)**.
>
> For this rule, MFPs include the following:

-   Associated persons involved in sales, trading, underwriting, and
    research services to municipal issuers

-   Associated persons who attempt to solicit municipal securities
    business in any capacity

-   Direct supervisors of associated persons who perform these
    functions, and

-   Executives or members of management teams of dealers or bank
    departments that engage in municipal securities business with
    issuers

> All firms are required to establish and maintain reporting
> requirements for political contri- butions to municipal issuers. All
> records relating to MFPs and political contributions must be
> maintained for six years. This rule also applies to municipal advisory
> firms and their employees, but for purposes of this exam, the focus is
> how it relates to municipal dealers and their employees.

1.  ***Ban on Conducting Business***

> If a municipal securities firm, an MFP of the firm, or a PAC
> controlled by the firm makes a political contribution to an official
> of an issuer, the firm is prohibited from engaging in any
> **negotiated** municipal securities business with that issuer for a
> period of **two years**.
>
> This prohibition applies to contributions made to incumbents or
> candidates for elective offices who are responsible for or can
> influence the awarding of municipal securities busi- ness.
> Contributions to officials who are in the position to appoint persons
> who can influence the awarding of municipal securities business also
> trigger the two-year prohibition.
>
> There is one exception. MFPs are allowed to make contributions without
> triggering the ban if the following applies:

-   They are entitled to vote for the candidate based on their residence
    or voting district, and

-   The contribution does not exceed \$250 per election

> If the MFP either gives a contribution in excess of \$250 or makes any
> contribution when not entitled to vote for the candidate, that would
> be a violation of the rule.
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules
>
> ***Example***
>
> A registered representative of a municipal securities firm is entitled
> to vote for an offi- cial of an issuer and makes a contribution of
> \$100. The firm may continue to engage in municipal securities
> business because the representative was entitled to vote and the
> contribution was less than \$250. A contribution of \$300 would have
> triggered the two- year ban for the firm.
>
> This exception does not apply to a PAC controlled by the firm or the
> firm itself. They cannot make contributions of any amount.

1.  ***Applications of Rule G-37***

> Many exceptions and complex situations apply to the administration of
> this rule. This sec- tion addresses a number of these to help provide
> further insight into the rule's application.

-   The ban against business *does not* extend to competitive
    underwritings because these activities are determined based on
    price. Only negotiated municipal securities activities are subject.

-   If a prohibited contribution has been made, and the individual who
    made the contribution leaves the firm, the original firm remains
    subject to the prohibition for the remainder of the two-year period.
    If the person that made the contribution works for a new municipal
    firm, and is defined as an MFP at that firm, the new firm is also
    subject to the ban on municipal securities business with that
    issuer.

> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules

-   If an individual made a political contribution while not classified
    as an MFP, and then later becomes an MFP, a two-year look-back
    applies to contributions made by that person. Any contributions made
    during that two-year period that would

> have been prohibited subject the employing firm to the ban on
> municipal securities business.

-   Contributions made by spouses of MFPs are not subject to the rule
    unless directed by the MFP.

-   If a check is drawn on a joint account of the MFP, and is signed by
    the MFP only, the contribution is deemed to have been made in full
    by the MFP. If the check is drawn on a joint account and signed by
    two parties, including the MFP, half the contribution is deemed made
    by the MFP.

-   If an official of a municipal issuer runs for federal office, and an
    MFP makes a political contribution of more than \$250 per election,
    the rule has been violated.

> G-37 is not violated if MFPs make contributions to other candidates
> for federal office---only those associated with municipal issuers. For
> example, the rule applies if a state governor is running for US
> president, but not if an incumbent US president is running for
> reelection.

###### Communications with the Public

> FINRA rules precisely detail permitted communications with investors.
> FINRA strictly regu- lates these communications to ensure that firms
> maintain the high and equitable standards discussed earlier and to
> prohibit any fraudulent or misleading information from being dis-
> seminated. This section will cover the different types of
> communications, along with filing and content requirements.

######### [Types of Communications]{.underline} 

> FINRA Rule 2210 defines three main types of communications with the
> public.

1.  **Retail communications** include any written or electronic
    communications distributed or made available to more than 25 retail
    investors within any

> 30-calendar-day period. This covers traditional print, internet, and
> TV ads.

2.  **Correspondence** includes any written or electronic communications
    distributed or made available to 25 or fewer retail investors in any
    30-calendar-day period.

3.  **Institutional communications** include any written or electronic
    communications distributed or made available exclusively to
    institutional investors.

> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules
>
> ***Example***
>
> If a communication went out to 10 retail clients and 20 institutional
> investors, it would be classified as a correspondence.
>
> **Purely verbal and oral** communication (e.g., a conversation) is not
> considered a commu- nication with the public.

######### [Review and Approval of Retail Communications]{.underline} 

> Unless an exception applies, all retail communications must be
> reviewed and approved by a registered principal prior to first use.
> The principal must sign and date each retail com- munication and
> ensure it is fair, balanced, and not misleading.
>
> Firms must retain records of all retail communications, including
> reviews and approvals, for at least three years after final use.

######### [Social Media and Other Online Communications]{.underline} 

> In response to the proliferation of interactive and social media,
> FINRA has covered it within its framework for communications with the
> public. A key regulatory distinction lies between static and
> interactive content online.

-   **Static content** does not change very often. Examples include
    website copy, information posted on a Facebook wall or profile, and
    blog posts---anything that was not written in response to a
    real-time, interactive online conversation. Static content is
    treated as a retail communication and subject to prior principal
    review.

-   **Interactive content** is in real-time, such as tweets, Facebook
    comments, or responses to comments on a blog post. It does not
    require prior principal review, but it is subject to supervision and
    spot checks. Put another way, the person responsible for tweeting
    must be aware of FINRA, and the firm's, content standards.

> Member firms must appropriately train associated persons regarding
> their policies for using and supervising interactive and social media.
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules

######### [MSRB Advertising]{.underline} 

> Similar rules of fair dealing and avoiding false and misleading
> information apply to munici- pal securities advertising. However, MSRB
> rules regarding communications with the public do differ from FINRA's.
>
> Under MSRB Rule G-21, a correspondence is defined as any written or
> electronic message distributed to 25 or fewer persons within a 90-day
> period. Examples include emails and instant messages. Firms are
> required to establish procedures for the review of these corre-
> spondences, but they are not required to be approved by a principal
> prior to first use. Take note, this is a different definition than
> that of FINRA's rules, which specifies a 30-day period.
>
> Unless deemed a correspondence, any material that is published or
> included in any elec- tronic or public media, or any written or
> electronic promotional literature made available to customers or the
> public, is defined as an advertisement. Examples include press
> releases, summaries of official statements, and newsletters. A
> principal must approve each advertise- ment in writing prior to first
> use. MSRB rules do not distinguish between advertisements being
> distributed to retail versus institutional investors.
>
> Official statements and preliminary official statements are excluded
> from the definition of advertising: In addition, because issuers of
> municipal securities are not subject to MSRB rules, any advertisements
> prepared by issuers are not subject to MSRB Rule G-21. However, an
> advertisement produced by a firm on behalf of an issuer must comply.
>
> Municipal securities firms must maintain records of all advertising
> and advertising approv- als for at least four years.
>
> *Chapter 14* Business Conduct Rules

###### Business Continuity Plans

> FINRA Rule 4370 requires broker-dealers to create and maintain written
> **business conti- nuity plans** to ensure that critical business
> functions are continually available to those that require access
> regardless of the circumstances. Examples of a business disruption
> could include a fire at the firm's office or a force majeure.
>
> The plan must be tailored to the size and scope of the firm's
> operations and ensure that the broker-dealer can continue to meet its
> obligations to its customers in spite of emergency circumstances or
> other disruptions. Back-up copies of the plan must be maintained in a
> secure location, and the plan must be available to FINRA staff
> promptly upon request.
>
> All broker-dealers must provide written disclosure of their business
> continuity plans to customers at account opening as well as on their
> website.

######### [Updating Plan Information]{.underline} 

> Business continuity plans must be updated in the event of any material
> change to the firm's operations, structure, business, or location.
> Firms must designate a member of senior man- agement, who is also a
> registered principal, to conduct annual reviews of the plan to deter-
> mine whether any changes are necessary.
>
> Firms must also designate two associated persons as emergency
> contacts. At least one emer- gency contact person must be a member of
> senior management and a registered principal of the firm.
>
> Emergency contact information must be reported to FINRA, and any
> changes to this infor- mation must be communicated promptly (within 30
> days).

#### Unit Exam---Solutions {#unit-examsolutions-13 .unnumbered}

1.  (**A**) Each broker-dealer's PATRIOT Act customer identification
    program (CIP) must be designed to obtain identifying information
    from *each* customer prior to account opening. There are no
    exceptions. Firms must also verify customers' identities within a
    reasonable time before or after account opening.

2.  (**B**) The Specially Designated Nationals List is maintained and
    published by the Office

> of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is a unit of the US Treasury
> that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against
> specified foreign countries and terrorist regimes. Any transaction
> with someone on this list must be blocked and reported to OFAC within
> 10 business days.

3.  (**C**) When a rep or his immediate family member wishes to open an
    account at another brokerage firm (not the employer), two things
    generally must happen. The employer firm must give prior written
    approval and the account-opening firm must know about the rep's
    employer, so it can send the employer duplicate copies of
    confirmations.

4.  (**A**) FINRA prohibits payments to unregistered persons. Neither a
    firm nor a rep can pay another person in connection with securities
    business, unless that person is securities- licensed. This
    prohibition also includes rebates or fee reductions to particular
    clients and finder's fees for new business.

5.  (**A**) Registered reps are only allowed to split cases and
    commissions/fees with other licensed persons. FINRA's rule against
    payments to unregistered persons prohibits any type of compensation,
    direct or indirect. Frank can't argue that he is splitting his
    earnings with the agent unless the agent is licensed. Also, he can't
    argue that this is

> a gift or gratuity ( for no value received) because FINRA prohibits
> reps from giving gifts or gratuities above \$100 in value. Giving four
> tickets worth \$200 each is egregiously expensive.

6.  (**B**) Retiring representatives may continue to participate in
    continuing commissions provided that they have a written contract
    with their employer prior to retirement. They must leave the
    securities industry and agree not to solicit new business, open new
    accounts, or service accounts.

7.  (**C**) Individuals employed by broker-dealers must notify their
    firms of any business activities that are outside the scope of their
    relationship with the firm---i.e., of any outside business activity
    (OBA). This applies to situations in which the employee accepts any
    compensation from an outside entity. The key to this regulation is
    that broker-dealers should know what their employees are doing on
    the outside.

8.  (**C**) For either a firm or an associated person, FINRA's limit on
    gifts and gratuities is \$100 of value per person per year. This
    limit does not apply to meals and sporting events, providing the
    registered rep attends the event and it is not egregiously
    expensive.

9.  (**B**) For an associated person to share an account with a
    customer, three requirements must be met: 1) prior written approval
    from the firm, 2) prior written approval from the client, and 3)
    sharing in accounts must be in proportion to each person's financial
    contribution.

10. (**C**) For an associated person to share an account with a
    customer, three requirements must be met: 1) prior written approval
    from the firm, 2) prior written approval from the client, and 3)
    sharing in accounts must be in proportion to each person's financial
    contribution. The third requirement does not apply to accounts
    shared with immediate family members, but the first two do apply.

11. (**B**) FINRA restricts registered persons from borrowing from and
    lending to customers. However, there are exceptions to this, such as
    borrowing from a bank or a family member. Another exception is
    borrowing based on a business or a personal relationship that is not
    work-related. That appears to be the case here. However, the firm's
    prior written approval of the loan is required under this exception.

12. (**D**) If a customer lodges a written complaint, it must be
    forwarded to a supervisor, even

> if the rep believes that he could resolve it himself. This is required
> even if the complaint is without merit.

13. (**C**) Retail communications include any written or electronic
    communications distributed or made available to more than 25 retail
    investors within any 30-calendar-day

> period. This cannot be correspondence because it is sent to more than
> 25 retail investors. It cannot be institutional communication unless
> it is sent exclusively to institutional clients.

14. (**D**) An MFP is allowed to contribute \$250 for both the primary
    and general election to an individual he is eligible to vote for. If
    he exceeds that limitation, his firm will be prohibited from doing
    any negotiated underwriting business with that municipality for two
    years.

15. (**A**) Unless an exception applies, all retail communications must
    be reviewed and approved by a registered principal prior to first
    use.

16. (**C**) FINRA member firms must designate two associated persons as
    emergency contacts in their business continuity plans. At least one
    of these must be a member of senior management and a registered
    principal. Emergency contact information must be reported to FINRA,
    and any changes in it must be updated within 30 days.
