title Market Participant Identifiers (MPIDs) Usage

start
: Each market maker has a unique MPID;
: Primary MPID for identifying the member;
: Additional MPIDs can be obtained for various purposes;
: Additional MPIDs often used for dark pool or OTC trades;

if (Primary MPID) then (Yes)
  : Primary MPID for core identification;
  : Must always have a **firm, two-sided quote**;
else (No)
  : Additional MPIDs can be used for specific purposes;
  : Such as reporting dark pool or OTC trades;
  : **Supplemental MPID quotes do not need to be two-sided**;
  : Can be withdrawn at any time;
endif

: **MPID issuance is a privilege, not a right**;

if (Requirements for Multiple MPIDs)
  : Members must identify legitimate purpose(s) and system(s) for each MPID;
  : Obtain written approval from FINRA Operations;
  : Quotation for OTC equity security and subsequent trade must use the same MPID;
else (Consequences)
  : FINRA may withdraw additional MPIDs for infractions;
  : Losing the right to use the primary MPID also restricts additional MPID usage;
