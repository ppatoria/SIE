* The limit order display rule¹, ².
** When they receive a customer order that is better than their current quote
** They must update their quote to reflect the price and size of the customer order, or execute the order immediately.
** The customer order is priced at the same level as the national best bid or offer (NBBO), which is better than the market maker's quote.
*** For example, if
**** the NBBO                    $10.00 x $10.05, and
**** the market maker is quoting $9.95 x $10.10,
**** a customer order to         buy at $10.00 or to sell at $10.05
**** would be better than the market maker's quote.
** The customer order is priced between the NBBO, which is better than the market maker's quote.
*** For example, if
**** the NBBO is                 $10.00 x $10.05, and
**** the market maker is quoting $9.95 x $10.10
**** a customer order to         buy at $10.01 or to sell at $10.04
**** would be better than the market maker's quote.
**  The customer order is priced outside the NBBO, which is better than the market maker's quote.
*** For example, if
**** the NBBO is                  $10.00 x $10.05, and
**** the market maker is quoting  $9.95 x $10.10
**** a customer order to buy at   $10.06 or to sell at $9.99 would be better than the market maker's quote.

* The minimum pricing increment rule¹, ².
** When they receive a customer order that is priced equal to the national best bid or offer (NBBO)
** They must update their quote to reflect the size of the customer order, or execute the order immediately.
*** For example, if
**** the NBBO                    $10.00 x $10.05, and
**** the market maker is quoting $9.95 x $10.10,
**** a customer order to         buy at $10.00 or to sell at $10.05
**** would be better than the market maker's quote.

* The sub-penny rule¹, ².
** Rule: Market participants can display Quote only if
*** greater than $0.01   if the price is equal to or greater than $1.00 per share or
*** greter  than $0.0001 if the price is less than $1.00 per share¹, ².
** Update quote when MM receive a customer order that is priced between the NBBO
*** Example
*** the NBBO for an NMS stock is   $10.00 x $10.05, and
*** a market maker is quoting    $9.99  x $10.06  for 100 shares each.
***  a customer order to  buy 50 shares at $10.02, which is between the NBBO.
*** MM must update their quote to reflect the price and size of the customer order, or execute the order immediately. as the sub-penny rule >0.001

* Trade Through:
** Execution of trade at prices inferior to protected quotations or NBBO.
*** Under the NMS rule, the market maker must also prevent a trade-through of the protected offer at $10.05.
*** If the market maker executes the order at $10.02, it must also send an intermarket sweep order (ISO) to execute against the full displayed size of the protected offer at $10.05, or route the order to a trading center that will do so.
*** If the market maker displays the order at $10.02, it must ensure that it does not execute any sell orders at $10.02 or higher until the protected offer at $10.05 is no longer available, or it sends an ISO to execute against it.



* The access fee rule¹, ².
MM cannot charge, for access to protected quotation, a fee that exceeds $0.0030 per share (or, for securities priced at less than $1.00 per share, 0.30% of the quotation price) for each round trip transaction². A round trip transaction is a transaction in which a market participant accesses a protected quotation and then subsequently provides liquidity at the same price level².

* Protected quote
** quote in an NMS stock that is displayed by an automated trading center
** It is protected from trade-throughs, i.e. trading center can't execute at a price inferior to protected quote.
** *The NBBO is calculated by consolidating the protected quotations from all trading centers and selecting the highest bid and the lowest offer*
* The locking and crossing rule¹, ².

** When MM receives order for price equal to NBBO; they can;t display the quote.
*** *MM receives a customer order to sell 100 shares at $10.00 which is the same as the NBBO bid.
***  The market maker must either execute the order immediately at $10.00, or route the order to another trading center that can execute it at $10.00 or better.
*** The market maker cannot display the order at $10.00, or lower its offer to $10.00, because that would lock the market with another market maker's bid at $10.00.
*** Same for offer

** When a market maker receives a customer order to sell at price which is lower than the NBBO bid
*** MM receives a customer order to sell 100 shares at $9.99, which is lower than the NBBO bid.
*** The market maker must either execute the order immediately at $9.99, or route the order to another trading center that can execute it at $9.99 or better.
*** The market maker cannot display the order at $9.99, or lower its offer to $9.99, because that would cross the market with another market maker's bid at $10.00.
*** Same for order highter than the NBBO.
** Prevent trade-through.

* CBOE's VIX index
** It measure the amount of volatility in the stock market
** It is computed based on the prices of options on the S&P 500 index


* A short call and a credit call are two different names for the same option strategy.
** is a bearish strategy that
** involves selling a call option
*** on a stock that the trader expects to fall in price.
** The trader receives a premium, for selling the call option and
** Hopes that the option will expire worthless, or out of the money,
*** so that they can keep the premium as profit.
** if the stock price rises above the strike price of the call option,
*** the trader will have to buy the stock at the higher market price and sell it at the lower strike price, resulting in a loss.
** The maximum profit of a short call is limited to the premium received, and
** the maximum loss is unlimited if the stock price rises indefinitely.

** Example
*** Suppose a trader is bearish on XYZ stock, which is trading at $50 per share.
*** The trader sells a call option on XYZ with a strike price of $55 and an expiration date of one month later.
*** The trader receives a premium of $2 per share, or $200 for the contract (100 shares per contract).
*** If XYZ stock falls below $55 by the expiration date, the call option will expire worthless, and the trader will keep the $200 premium as profit.
**** This is the best-case scenario for the trader, and the maximum profit they can make from this strategy.
*** If XYZ stock rises above $55 by the expiration date, the call option will be in the money, and the trader will be assigned to deliver 100 shares of XYZ at $55 per share.
**** The trader will have to buy the shares at the market price, which could be higher than $55, and sell them at the strike price, resulting in a loss.
****  This is the worst-case scenario for the trader, and the loss could be even higher if the stock price rises above strike price.

* Credit Spread or specifically a "credit call spread", is
** a two-part options strategy that
*** involves
**** selling a call option and
**** buying another call option at a higher strike price.
*** Both options have the same expiration date.
*** The aim is to
**** earn the premium from the sale of the short call, but
**** also to limit potential losses by owning a call option.

** Example
*** the current stock price of Company XYZ is $100.
*** An investor can initiate a credit call spread by:
**** Selling a call option (i.e., writing a short call) with a strike price of $105 and earning a premium of $10.
**** Buying a call option with a strike price of $110 for a premium of $8.
*** The net income from this transaction is the difference in premiums, which is $2 ($10 - $8).
*** If the stock price stays below $105, both options expire worthless, and the investor keeps the net premium of $2 as profit.
*** If the stock price rises above $105 but stays below $110,
**** the sold call option will be exercised, and the investor has to sell the stock at $105.
**** However, the bought call option expires worthless.
**** The investor's profit is still the net premium, but now reduced by the difference between the stock price and the $105 strike price.
**** If the stock price goes above $110, both options are exercised.
**** The investor has to sell stock at $105,
**** but they can buy it at $110.
**** The loss from this is offset by the net premium received.

* Differences and Similarities of short call and credit call spread .

** similarity
*** both strategies involve writing a call option and can profit when the stock price stays below the strike price of the written option.

** difference lies in their risk profiles:
*** A short call has unlimited risk. If the stock price skyrockets, the losses could be substantial.
*** A credit call spread, on the other hand, has a capped risk.
**** The call option purchased acts as an insurance policy that limits the losses if the stock price increases significantly.

** Example of Long Straddle
*** If the investor thinks that the price of a stock will change significantly but does not know in which direction.
*** The stock is currently trading at $50,
*** and the investor buys a call and a put option with a strike price of $50
*** and an expiration date of one month later.
*** Each option costs $2, so the total cost of the long straddle is $4.
*** This means that the investor needs the stock price to move more than $4 in either direction to make a profit.
*** If the stock price rises to $60 after the earnings report, the investor can exercise the call option and buy the stock for $50,
*** then sell it for $60, making a profit of $10 per share. However, the investor also has to subtract the cost of the options, which is $4, so the net profit is $6 per share.
*** If the stock price falls to $40 after the earnings report, the investor can exercise the put option and sell the stock for $50,
*** then buy it back for $40, making a profit of $10 per share. Again, the investor has to subtract the cost of the options, which is $4, so the net profit is $6 per share.
*** If the stock price stays at $50 or moves less than $4 in either direction, the investor will lose money, because the options will expire worthless and the investor will lose the $4 paid for them.

** Example of Short Straddle
*** *Suppose another investor thinks that the price of the same stock will not change much after the earnings report,* and expects the implied volatility to drop.
*** *The stock is still trading at $50,* and the investor sells a call and a put option with a strike price of $50
*** and an expiration date of one month later.
*** Each option pays $2, so the total income of the short straddle is $4.
*** This means that the investor needs the stock price to stay within $4 of the strike price to make a profit.
*** If the stock price stays at $50 or moves less than $4 in either direction, the investor will keep the $4 received from selling the options, which is the maximum profit.
*** If the stock price rises above $54 or falls below $46,
*** the investor will lose money,
**** because the options will be exercised by the buyers
**** and the investor will have to buy or sell the stock at an unfavorable price.
**** The potential loss is unlimited, as the stock price can move infinitely higher or lower.
*** If the implied volatility drops, the investor can also close the position early by buying back the options at a lower price, and lock in a profit without waiting for expiration.

* No-bid
**  a situation where there are no buyers for a particular security at any price.
