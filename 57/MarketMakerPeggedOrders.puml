*Details:*
MM Pegged order is a **two-step process**.
(I) The order is pegged by sending it to the exchange .
    This means that the order is automatically
    adjusted by the system to stay within the defined
    limits as market prices fluctuate.
(II) Once the order is pegged, it is eligible for
     execution if there is enough available interest
     on the other side of the market.

The process of a Market Maker Pegged order for buying
a stock, incorporating all the steps and adjustments
mentioned in the provided example.

(*) A Market Maker enters an MM Pegged Order
    to **buy** a stock currently quoted **at $10**.

(*) The **Nasdaq System retrieves the current
    market data**, including the inside Bid and
    Ask prices.

(*) The Nasdaq System prices the MM Pegged Order,
    setting it **8% below the Best Bid**, which is
    **the minimum bid price permissible**, resulting
    in an initial price of **$9.20**.

(*) **If the Best Bid moves higher (e.g., to $10.50)**,
    the MM Pegged Order **automatically adjusts** to
    stay **within 9.5%** below the new Best Offer
    **(adjusted price: $9.51)**.
    **NOTE**: It is adjusted to 9.5% below not 8%
    because for **Existing Quote** the permissible
    minimum bid is 9.5% while for **New Quote**
    it is 8%

(*) The OrderMatchingEngine matches the MM Pegged Order
    with available liquidity in the market, and a trade
    is executed.

(*) Execution confirmations are sent to the MarketMaker.
