8. Options Contracts and
Strategies
Options are financial instruments that provide investors an opportunity to spec-
ulate on changing prices or protect existing positions. An option is a derivative
contract because its value is derived from the price of another asset, called the
underlying asset. These contracts—and options contracts are legal, binding
contracts—bring two parties together under standardized terms and conditions.
All option contracts have a buyer and a seller, with each party bearing certain
rights and obligations. This chapter will discuss the different options contracts
that exist, the risks and opportunities for buyers and sellers of options contracts,
and the strategies involved in the options marketplace.
Knopman Note: Options questions on the Series 57 will focus on complex
positions, including spreads, straddles, and combinations. Answering
questions on complex strategies requires a strong understanding of
options fundamentals, including single options. Candidates who need
a review of fundamental options positions should read the options
addendum in the www.knopman.com Training Center before reviewing
this chapter.
8.1 Spreads
A spread position involves an investor simultaneously making an opening pur-
chase (buying) and an opening sale (writing) of the same number of contracts
on the same underlying asset within the same option class (calls or puts) but
from different series. If the spread involves two calls (one bought, one sold), it is
a call spread. Conversely, if the spread involves two puts (one bought, one sold),
it is a put spread.
In many cases, brokers will execute the spread as a unit in a single transaction,
as opposed to in one opening purchase and one opening sale (though, if executed
separately, the position retains the same characteristics). All spreads are mod-
erate positions and allow investors to achieve either bullish or bearish exposure.

Options Contracts
and Strategies
Knopman Note: The type of spread is determined by the contract
feature that is different.
•••If the strike prices are different, but the expiration months are the
same, the spread is a vertical or price spread.
If the strike prices are the same, but the expiration months are
different, the spread is a horizontal or calendar spread.
If both the strike prices and the expiration months are different, the
spread is a diagonal spread.
Spreads can either be long or short, as described in the next section.
8.1.1 Long (Debit) Spreads
A long spread, or a debit spread, is a position that requires a net debit (or net
cash outflow) to be established. Because all spreads have one position that is
being bought and one position that is being sold, a debit spread indicates that the
opening purchase will cost more (have a higher premium) than the simultaneous
opening sale (which will have a lower premium). As discussed later, the option
with the higher premium is sometimes referred to as the dominant position.
A long (debit) spread does not indicate whether the investor is bullish or bearish;
it only indicates that the investor bought the more expensive option and sold a
less expensive one.
Once an investor has entered into a debit spread and paid a net premium, the
investor hopes that the spread, or the difference between the two premiums, will
widen. If the spread does widen, the investor will earn a profit on the position.
This results from the fact that in a debit spread, the more expensive option was
purchased in the opening leg and will be sold in the closing leg.
Example: Debit Call Spread (Bullish)

Bullish/Bearish: This position is bullish because the investor is mostly buying calls, and buying calls is bullish.
Described differently, the option with the higher premium determines whether the position is bullish or
bearish.

An investor profits in a debit spread from the widening of premiums. The
example below illustrates the closing of the position at expiration for intrin-
sic value when the market value of ABC stock is $62. Closing the position
means that the investor is offsetting each leg—the opening purchase will be
offset with a closing sale, while the opening sale will be offset with a closing
purchase. Closing the position does not involve exercise of the option; it is
about liquidating the position.

$1,000.
The overall profit on the position is $700, which results from the net premium of $300 paid to open the
position and the net premium of $1,000 received from closing the position.
Knopman Note: When creating a call spread position, the call option
with the lower strike price will be the dominant position, which the
investor’s attitude is based upon. For example, if an investor buys a May
30 call and sells a May 40 call, the May 30 call would be the dominant
position (since it has the lower strike price) and it is a bullish position
(since buying calls is the dominant position).
An investor loses profit in a debit spread if the premiums narrow. The example

Debit Spread Maximum Gain, Maximum Loss, and Breakeven
Investors use debit spreads to establish the potential to profit on a long option
position, but with a reduced cost. The premium paid for the long option position
is reduced by the premium received from the sale of another option. There is,
however, a tradeoff for the use of this cost-reduction strategy; a limit on the profit
potential is set by the strike price of the short option position.
The maximum gain, maximum loss, and breakeven points of debit spread posi-
tions will be reviewed through the examples below.
Example: Debit Call Spread (Bullish)
The example below illustrates the investor’s outcome when the market value
of ABC is $52 at expiration.

The overall profit on the position is $+200. The $300 opening debit is offset by the $500
closing credit. This $200 represents the most an investor can make on this particular
spread. Even if the stock increases to, for example, $100, the profit will still be $200.
Knopman Note: Investors who establish debit call spreads are
moderately bullish because they limit their potential upside to make the
position less costly. They give up any profit above the strike price of the
short call.

The maximum gain for a debit (bull) call spread occurs when both options expire
in the money and are exercised or closed out at intrinsic value. If exercised, the
investor will buy the stock at the lower strike and cover the exercise assignment
by selling the shares just acquired at the short call’s higher strike. The investor
cannot make more than the higher strike price of the short call because of the
obligation to sell, regardless of how high the market value of the underlying stock
may rise. Once the market value of the stock exceeds the higher strike, every
dollar gained on the long call is offset by the exact loss to the investor on the
short call.
If at expiration the market value of the stock is between the strikes, the long call
will be in the money and exercised (or liquidated), and the short call will expire
out of the money.
If at expiration the market value is below both strike prices, then both options
will expire worthless and the loss will be the premium paid (i.e., net debit).

Knopman Note: A put spread is 1) bearish and 2) a debit when the
investor purchases a put contract with a higher strike price and sells a
put contract with a lower strike price.
8.1.2 Short (Credit) Spreads
A short spread, or a credit spread, is a position that delivers a net credit (or
net cash inflow) when it is opened. This results when the opening sale generates
excess premium over the cost of the opening purchase. Investors can open credit
spreads that are bullish (short put spread) or bearish (short call spread). Investors
who open a short or credit spread want the position to narrow. If the position
does narrow, the investor will keep some of the opening net premium, therefore
profiting on the position.
Knopman Note: A trick to remember whether an investor hopes for
a spread to widen or narrow is to look at the number of letters in the
words.
• Debit spreads widen: “Debit” has five letters; “widen” has five letters.
• Credit spreads narrow: “Credit” has six letters; “narrow” has six
letters.
Example: Credit Call Spread (Bearish)
An investor with a bearish market view enters into a credit call spread, as
shown below.

An investor that establishes a credit spread is profitable if the spread nar-
rows. The best case is if the spread narrows all the way to zero, which occurs
when both options are out of the money.

Knopman Note: A bear call spread is established with two positions:
1. Selling a call with a low strike price, and
2. Buying a call with a higher strike price
It is also referred to as a “credit call spread.” The market view of this
position is bearish.
Credit Spread Maximum Gain, Maximum Loss, and Breakeven
Credit spreads are used to reduce the risk of a single short option position. By also
buying an option, the investor can limit the risk of the position substantially. The
tradeoff for the risk reduction is the investor’s cost of protection, which reduces
the income received from writing an option.
Credit call and credit put strategies and their maximum gains, maximum losses,
and breakeven points will be reviewed in the examples below.

If GNG falls below 95, both options will expire out of the money and Mike
keeps the net premium ($500).
But If GNG rises above 105, Mike will receive an exercise assignment against
his short 95 call. His loss on the stock will be limited to $10 per share because
he can buy the stock he must deliver at $95 by exercising his long call for
the right to buy the stock at 105. His loss on the stock is offset by the net $5
premium earned for a total loss of $5 per share. Regardless of how high the
stock price moves, the maximum loss is limited to $5 per share because of
the dollar-for-dollar offset.

The use of a credit call spread allows Mike to generate income from the pre-
mium received for writing a call, but removes the unlimited risk associated
with uncovered call writing.
Mike’s breakeven is $100. His position is profitable between 95 and 100, and
Mike takes losses between 100 and 105.
In a credit put spread, an investor sells a put with a higher strike and buys a put
with a lower strike. Because the put with the higher strike price has the higher
premium, the result is a net credit to the investor’s account. The investor achieves
maximum gain if the underlying asset increases in value and both options expire
worthless. The losses on the position are limited by the short put, which can be
exercised if the long put receives an exercise assignment.

Knopman Note: Here is a summary of key spread items:
The dominant position is always the position with the higher premium. It
indicates whether the spread is bullish or bearish and is also used to find
the breakeven point.
To find the breakeven, use the strategy of “call up, put down.” For calls,
add the net premium to the strike price of the dominant position—call
up. For puts, subtract the net premium from the strike price of the
dominant position—put down.
When asked to find the maximum gain (i.e., maximum revenue) or maximum
loss, always include the premiums in the calculation. Note that premiums are
still considered even if the question asks one to exclude fees. The premium is not a
fee—it is the market price of the option.
Knopman Note: A butterfly spread is made up of four options, all with
the same expiration, three with different strike prices, for example, buy
1 Oct 50 call, sell 2 Oct 60 calls, and buy 1 Oct 70 call. Therefore, a two-
option position could not be a butterfly spread.
Also note that a butterfly spread consists of two contracts on the outside
and two contracts in the middle—e.g., Buy 1 50 call, Sell 2 60 calls, Buy 1
70 call. Described differently, it is a 1-2-1 position, not a 2-1-2 position.

8.2 Straddles
A straddle is an options strategy that uses options from both the call class and
the put class simultaneously, with each option having the same strike price and
expiration. Investors can use long or short straddles to achieve specific exposure
and goals.
Knopman Note:
Q: How does a straddle differ from a spread?
A: A straddle involves options of two classes (one call, one put) on the
same side of the market (both long or both short), whereas a spread
position only uses options from one class (two calls, or two puts) on
opposite sides of the market (one long, one short).
8.2.1 Long Straddle
A long straddle is established with two options: a long call and a long put with
the same underlying asset, strike price, and expiration. This position will profit if
the underlying asset increases or decreases in value; the key is that the price of the
underlying asset must change. The long straddle is referred to as a volatility play.
Investors use long straddles when they expect a large price change, but are
unsure in which direction the move will be—the price may increase a lot, or the
price might fall a lot, but the investor does not believe the stock will remain flat.
For example, an investor may use a long straddle if a company is expecting a
major court decision or shareholder vote that will materially impact the business.
If the outcome is in the company’s favor, the stock will shoot upward, and if the
outcome is not in the company’s favor, the stock will tank. The long straddle
allows potential profit for the investor in either outcome.
As with all long option positions, the long straddle is subject to time decay, so the
upward or downward price move must occur prior to expiration for profitability.
Knopman Note:
Q: What type of investor should buy a straddle?
A: An investor who expects increased volatility should enter a long
straddle (buy a call, buy a put). The long straddle is not bullish; it is a
volatility play.

Example
Perry has identified a company (BUX) that is in major litigation. BUX’s stock
price is currently $17. If the company wins the case, he expects the stock price
to soar, but if the case is lost, he expects the stock price to fall dramatically.
What options strategy can he use to profit regardless of the litigation outcome?
Perry could enter into a long straddle, as shown below.

in-the-money call and let the out-of-the-money put expire. If the company
loses the case and the stock tanks, Perry will exercise the in-the-money put
and let the out-of-the-money call expire worthless.
To break even, Perry must recover the aggregate premiums. If the stock
appreciates, Perry breaks even at $18.30 and begins to profit above that. If
the market value declines, Perry breaks even at $15.70 and begins to profit as
it continues to fall.
What is the worst-case scenario for Perry? If the court does not issue a rul-
ing in August, and instead indicates the judgment will be handed down in
September, Perry’s options could both expire worthless resulting in the loss
of both premiums.
To summarize, Perry breaks even at $18.30 and $15.70; above $18.30 and below
$15.70 he makes money because there is enough volatility to offset the premi-
ums paid. Between $15.70 and $18.30 Perry loses money, as there is not enough
volatility to offset the premiums paid.
The payout structure of the long straddle from the previous example is shown
below. Straddles take a V shape, where the point reflects the maximum loss on
the position.

8.2.2. Short Straddle (Straddle Writing)
A short straddle has the opposite view of the long straddle and is for investors
who expect the underlying asset’s price to remain flat or within a narrow trading
range. To enter a short straddle, the investor will write a call and a put option on
the same underlying asset, each with the same expiration and strike price. The
short straddle offers limited rewards but unlimited risk.
Knopman Note: An investor who expects little volatility (i.e., flat
markets) should enter into a short straddle position (short call and short
put). A short combination, similar to a straddle, would also achieve the
same effect.
Example
Sam believes the stock of XYZ Conglomerate, which is currently $27, is likely
to remain flat for the rest of the year. She wants to enter a position that will
earn income if her prediction is accurate. Which options strategy may be
appropriate?
Sam can write a short straddle, as shown below.

Sell 1 XYZ Dec 27 Call
Sell 1 XYZ Dec 27 Put

$1.51
$2.78
At the end of the year, if XYZ remains at $27 per share, Sam will profit because
both options will expire out of the money. She will retain the total premiums
of $278.
If, however, XYZ has moved up in value, the call will be exercised; if XYZ falls
in value, the put will be exercised.
The $2.78 in premiums collected provide a buffer from volatility. If the stock
moves exactly $2.78 in either direction—to $29.78 or $24.22—the customer
breaks even. If the stock moves above $29.78 or below $24.22, the customer
loses money because the combined premiums are not enough protection.
Between $24.22 and $29.78, the customer makes money.

Knopman Note: If the investor enters a straddle (long or short) with
options that have different strike prices—e.g., a higher call strike and
a lower put strike, or vice versa—the position is called a strangle or a
combination. A long or short combination has the exact same attitude
as a long or short straddle. For example, a long combination, like a long
straddle, speculates that the stock will be volatile.
Knopman Note: Here are a few key points to know about complex orders,
including spreads and straddles:
••Attitude of spreads v. straddles:
••Spreads allow an investor to take a moderate position on a
security. If, for example, an investor is bullish on a stock but
believes gains will be only modest, he could enter a debit call
spread, which will offer limited upside, but at a lower cost
than buying a call outright.
Straddles allow investors to bet on the volatility of a stock,
not on the direction. For example, an investor who expects a
stock to stay flat over a period of time could sell a straddle. An
investor with a market view on a security (bullish or bearish)
would not create a spread.
Creating straddles and spreads:
••Straddles involve “buying both” or “selling both,” that is, both
calls and puts. Therefore, an investor who is already long a call
could buy a put to create a straddle.
Spreads, on the other hand, involve two calls or two puts—
buying one and selling one. For example, an investor who is
long a put and wants to create a spread would need to sell a
put.

8.3 Index-Based Options
An index-based option is an option contract whose value is not derived from the
value of an underlying share of stock but is instead based on the closing value of
an index or group of securities (e.g., the S&P 500). There are many index options
contracts, all referencing a wide array of underlying indices, including broad- and
narrow-based, domestic and international, sector-specific, and indices based on
volatility (e.g., VIX). Examples of index-based options include:
Examples of Index Options
Broad
• SPX (S&P 500)
• OEX (S&P 100 Index Options)
• NDX (Nasdaq 100: 100 of the largest non-financial securities
listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market)
• DJX (The Dow Jones Industrial Average)
• RUT (Russell 2000: Small-cap segment)
Narrow
• An index based on nine or fewer underlying components
Foreign
• MXEA (MSCI EAFE: International equity performance in
Europe, Australasia, and the Far East)
Volatility
• VIX (The VIX Index is based on expected stock market
volatility)
Index options operate in substantially the same way as equity options, with each
contract providing similar rights to buyers and obligations to sellers. One differ-
ence is that index options settle for cash (meaning the parties do not transfer
any underlying securities, but instead deliver the cash value of the contract on
exercise). The amount delivered on exercise is called the exercise settlement
amount.
Knopman Note: Index options are always settled for cash.
8.3.1 Exercise Settlement Amount and the 100× Multiplier
If an index option is exercised, the parties do not actually exchange the under-
lying shares in the index; instead, index options settle for cash. This means the
parties use the strike price and the index’s closing value to determine the pro-
ceeds due to the exercising party. This amount is then adjusted by a contractual
288
multiplier of 100× to determine the final exercise settlement amount due to the
owner of the option.
One of the most actively traded index options is the SPX contract, which is
based off the closing value of the S&P 500 Index. SPX options allow investors to
achieve market exposure in the overall US equity markets, hedge their portfolios,
and produce income.
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is a federal law that pro-
tects private-sector retirement plans such as 401(k) plans. Importantly, an ERISA
plan is permitted to trade options (e.g., protective puts or covered calls) as long
as it meets the investment criteria of the plan.
Knopman Note: Index options can be purchased in an ERISA-sponsored
plan provided they conform with the plan’s investment policy and that
no margin is required (since ERISA accounts must be cash accounts). For
example, selling uncovered calls requires a margin deposit and therefore
would be prohibited.
8.3.2 VIX Options
Another popular index option available to investors is the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index, or the VIX Index. The VIX measures market
sentiment and expected volatility in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days. Put dif-
ferently, the VIX Index measures how much the market believes the S&P 500 will
move up or down in the next 30 days. The more volatility expected, the higher the
VIX Index value goes; the less volatility expected, the lower the VIX Index. The
VIX Index typically ranges from 10 (low expected volatility) to 50 (high expected
volatility), though it spiked to over 80 during the 2008 financial crisis.
Knopman Note: The VIX measures expected volatility based on the S&P
500 index.
In general, volatility has had an inverse relationship with stock market returns;
thus if the market as a whole is bullish, the expected volatility is typically lower,
and the VIX Index value will also be lower. If, on the other hand, the market is
bearish, there is an expectation that volatility will be higher, and, therefore, that
the VIX Index value will also be higher.
Here is how investors can use VIX options or SPX options based on their market
views:

Knopman Note: To summarize, VIX Index options allow investors to
speculate on investor sentiment and market volatility. Importantly, the
VIX Index is inverse to the market; so as the market rises, the VIX falls.
When the market falls, the VIX rises. Described differently, a bearish
investor would purchase VIX calls.
8.4 Foreign Currency Options
Foreign currency options (FX options) are available to investors who wish
to express their views on the strength or weakness of the US dollar relative to
various global currencies. Through FX options, investors can accomplish strat-
egies similar to those available with equity and index options. They are able to
speculate, hedge, and produce income based on their beliefs.
There are no currency contracts available on the US dollar, although all contracts
are settled in US dollars.
Information about commonly traded foreign currency options is shown in the
table below.

Knopman Note: Foreign currency options have a contract size of 10,000
units of currency (i.e., 10,000 pounds, Euros, or Canadian dollars). The
exception is Japanese yen. Options denominated in Japanese yen have a
contract size of 1,000,000 yen.
8.4.1 Strike Prices and Premiums of Foreign Currency Options
Strike prices and premiums for nearly all FX options are quoted in US cents.
Japanese yen options are an exception, and their strike price is quoted in hun-
dredths of a cent ($0.0001). Most contracts for foreign currency include 10,000
units, except for the yen, which includes 1,000,000 yen.
The value of an FX contract is determined by multiplying the strike price by the
contract size, and then multiplying the result by the premium subject to its mul-
tiplier, typically 100. The calculations of profit and loss on FX options are substan-
tially the same as for equity and index options.
Example
In June, one Euro buys $1.12 in USD, but Rich believes the USD will appreciate
against the EUR and that, by year end, the two currencies will be equal. What
option strategy can Rich use to profit on his belief ?
Rich believes that the US dollar will strengthen against the Euro. Because
there are no FX options available on the dollar, Rich must plot his strategy
based on the Euro, which he expects to fall. Because he expects the Euro to
fall, or is bearish, he could buy puts or sell calls on the Euro.
Assume Rich buys 1 EUR 1.12 Dec put at 3.19.
If Rich is correct in his market outlook, this option contract will allow Rich
to receive cash in the amount of the difference between the strike price and
Euro spot rate, which is the financial term used for the settlement price for
commodities and currencies. If he is incorrect, his maximum loss is the pre-
mium he paid for the Euro put.
Assume the Euro spot rate at expiration is 1.00. Rich receives the difference
between the strike price of 1.12 and the spot rate of 1.00. Remember, the strike
and the premium are quoted in cents, so the difference of 12 cents must be
multiplied by 10,000 units of currency to determine the settlement value. The
settlement value of 1,200 cents is equal to $12, which is then multiplied by the
multiplier of 100 for a total cash settlement value of 120,000 cents or 1,200 US
dollars. Rich’s profit on this transaction is $1,200 minus the premium of $319,
which equals $881.
If Rich had sold a EUR 1.12 Dec call at 4 instead, he would have profited from
the premium of $400. At expiration, this contract would expire because the
EUR is worth less than 1.12.

8.4.2 Hedging with FX Options
Foreign currency options are frequently used for hedging when businesses engage
in foreign trade. They provide protection against adverse currency movements.
Because there are no options on the US dollar, the investor’s viewpoint on the
currency exchange must be expressed in terms of the foreign currency.
◆ An investor that believes the USD will strengthen against the JPY believes
the JPY will weaken against the USD.
◆ An investor that believes the USD will fall against the EUR believes the
EUR will strengthen against the USD.
The first step in hedging with FX options is identifying the risk to the investor.
Example
A US company exports its goods to Europe and receives payment in EUR.
The CFO believes the USD will appreciate against the EUR. What FX options
position will hedge against this risk?
Identify the risk: The dollar appreciating against the EUR will cause the
CFO’s company to lose money. The options strategies to hedge against this
risk are those that are profitable when this occurs.
The CFO should buy puts on the EUR to lock in the right to sell his EUR at the
strike price if the company’s value falls because the dollar appreciates. Buying
EUR puts provides the best hedge for this risk.
Potential outcomes: If the CFO is right and the USD strengthens and the
EUR weakens, the CFO can exercise the EUR puts. The EURs can be sold at
the higher strike, instead of at the lower current conversion rate.
If the CFO is wrong and the USD weakens and the EUR strengthens, the CFO
will allow the EUR puts to expire worthless, losing the premium paid.
Example
A Canadian company sells goods to a US customer and receives payment in
USD. The Canadian firm then converts the USD into Canadian dollars (CAD)
to pay its employees, vendors, suppliers, and dividends to shareholders. How
can the firm best manage its risk with FX options?
Identify the risk: The risk to the Canadian company is a weakening US dollar.
The company could buy fewer CAD if the USD weakens. Puts on the US dollar
are not available, but the investor could instead buy calls on the CAD. With
this strategy, the company can purchase Canadian dollars at the lower strike
price if the USD loses value against the CAD.
Potential outcomes: If the USD weakens and the CAD appreciates, the firm
exercises the CAD calls, and can buy CAD at the strike price to make pay-
ments to employees, vendors, and suppliers, and pay dividends.
If the USD strengthens and the CAD weakens, the calls will expire worthless
and the premium will be lost. But the firm can buy cheaper CAD, because of
the stronger USD, to meet its liabilities and pay dividends.
Knopman Note: To take advantage of a strong foreign economy, an
investor can buy calls in that currency. For example, if the French
economy looks strong and France has falling unemployment, an investor
should buy EUR calls. If, however, a foreign economy is weakening, an
investor should buy puts on that currency.
8.5 Listed Options Contracts
The exam focuses on listed options contracts. Why listed options? Listed
options are standardized contracts that provide for orderly, efficient, and liq-
uid markets. The most important registered exchange for options trading is the
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), though options also trade on other
exchanges.
Knopman Note: OTC options are created individually between two
counterparties. The key difference between OTC and exchange-listed
options is that OTC options have counterparty risk.
Listed options are those traded on a registered national securities exchange or
issued and guaranteed by a registered clearing agency. All options that are cleared
by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) are considered listed options. Let’s
define these terms to better understand the universe of testable options contracts.
◆◆Registered clearing agency—A registered clearing agency oversees the
events that occur after trade execution but before settlement on T + 1,
such as comparing contraparty trade data for accuracy and authenticity,
sending instructions for automated settlement of those trades, and
providing a central counterparty guarantee to ensure successful and
complete settlement.
Issued and guaranteed—The listed options contracts discussed
above—nearly all calls and puts on equities, indices, and interest rates—
are initially issued by the OCC. As the issuer of these options, the OCC
serves as the central counterparty to every option market participant.
This counterparty guarantee is of great value because options contracts
are long-dated and require that the writer be able to perform months
after entering into options contracts. Because the OCC stands as the
counterparty for every contract, options traders can transact in the
secondary market without having to find their original or assigned
opposite parties, or worrying about whether that counterparty will be
able to perform at the time of expiration. All premium and settlement
payments are made between OCC and its clearing members. To provide
this counterparty guarantee, the OCC requires that every buyer and
seller (e.g., retail customer) transact through a clearing firm (e.g., a
broker-dealer) that meets stringent capital requirements and posts
adequate collateral, which the OCC can use to ensure settlement.

Knopman Note: The Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA) collects,
consolidates, and disseminates options market data (last sale and quotes)
from options exchanges. Think of OPRA as the reporting facility for
options transactions, similar to the consolidated tape or TRF.
8.6 Assignment and Exercise
Options contracts have provisions that govern when the holder can exercise.
There are two styles of expiration: American-style and European-style.
8.6.1 American-Style Exercise
American-style options contracts allow the holder of the option to give exercise
notice on any day that the market is open before the expiration date. The last
day to exercise a monthly American-style option is usually the third Friday of
the month in which the contract expires. Put differently, as soon as the buyer of
the option takes ownership of an American-style options contract, the investor
can give exercise instructions, and the OCC will deliver an exercise notice to a
writer of the same options contract. However, owners of American-style options
often choose to realize their profits (or losses) by selling the contract in a closing
transaction as opposed to exercising the contract.
8.6.2 European-Style Exercise
European-style options contracts permit exercise only during a specified period
of time just prior to expiration—generally the last trading day before expiration
(for most options, expiration is the third Friday of the expiration month). Although
the window for exercise is much narrower for European-style options, investors
can close their positions (realizing any profit or loss) with a closing transaction
at any point prior to expiration. Because of the ability to liquidate European-style
options contracts at any time, most investors are indifferent to the exercise style.
Knopman Note: Be sure to review the chart below as to which types of
options are typically American-style as opposed to European-style.

294
8.6.3 Assignment
Most options positions are closed out prior to expiration with offsetting closing
transactions, but it is important to be familiar with the procedures and rules
governing options exercise.
Once an option has been assigned, the writer must sell (calls) or buy (puts) the
underlying asset at the strike price or, for index and other cash-settled options,
deliver the cash settlement amount.
When an options holder decides to exercise his options, he will give notice to his
broker-dealer, which will in turn notify the OCC by tendering an exercise notice.
An exercise notice may be tendered to the Options Clearing Corporation only
by the Clearing Trading Permit Holder that carries the customer’s account. A
Clearing Trading Permit Holder is a member of the OCC that is authorized to
trade, clear, and tender exercise notices on behalf of its clients.
Once a Clearing Trading Permit Holder tenders an exercise notice, the OCC uses a
random selection process to deliver a notice of assignment to a clearing member
firm that has a customer with an outstanding short position in the same option
series. The receiving clearing member firm will then allocate assignments among
its customers using random selection or on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
Knopman Note: When an option is exercised, the OCC assigns an exercise
notice to a broker-dealer using random selection. A broker-dealer will
then assign delivery to a customer who is short the equivalent position
using random selection, first-in first-out, or any other fair and equitable
method.
Knopman Note: Options can be exercised up until 5:30 pm (ET) on the
third Friday of the expiration month. An investor who owns an out-of-
the-money option at this time will let it expire.
8.7 Settlement, Position Limits, and Exercise Limits
To help maintain fair and orderly markets, and prevent manipulation, partici-
pants in the options market are subject to a variety of rules governing the trading
and settlement, holding, and exercising of options. These include rules set by
FINRA (such as Rule 2360) as well as those set by the OCC, the CBOE, and the
other SROs that regulate options contracts.
Chapter 8
Options Contracts
and Strategies
295
Chapter 8
Options Contracts
and Strategies
296
8.7.1 Listed Options Settlement
After an option is bought or sold, the trade will settle on the next business day.
The term settlement describes when a securities transaction is complete; when
purchasing an option contract, on the settlement date the buyer must pay the
premium and will receive legal title to the security. With legal title to the contract,
the holder can then exercise (enter a second transaction to buy or sell at the
strike) or liquidate (enter into a closing sale) as desired. Conversely, on settlement
the writer of an option will receive the premiums and is subject to receiving an
assignment notice requiring the purchase (puts) or sale (calls) of the underlying
asset. These settlement timeframes are constant across both opening and closing
transactions.
Knopman Note: The settlement timeframe for buying and selling options
contracts is T + 1, which is different when compared to buying and selling
equities and corporate or municipal bonds, which settle T + 2.
Knopman Note: Options typically cannot be purchased on margin (using
borrowed funds). Therefore, a customer buying two options contracts at
a premium of $14 per contract would need to pay $2,800 ($14 per Share
× 100 Shares × 2 Contracts) at settlement. Note that if the customer
already had more than $2,800 in their account, no deposit of cash would
be required to make the purchase.
8.7.2 Position Limits
Position limits restrict the number of contracts a single entity or investor group
may own on each side of the market. For the purpose of position limits, the sides
of the market are bullish positions (long calls or short puts) and bearish positions
(long puts or short calls). The rules prohibit any member from entering a trade
that would cause an account, including a customer’s account or the firm’s own
proprietary trading account, to exceed the position limit as set by the exchange
where the option trades or by FINRA. Any orders that would result in the position
limit being exceeded must be rejected.
Knopman Note: When determining the number of options contracts
an investor has on each side of the market to ensure the investor is not
exceeding position limits, add up bullish positions on one side of the
market (long calls and short puts) and bearish positions on the other side
of the market (long puts and short calls).
For example, 5,000 long calls and 4,000 short puts are aggregated as
a 9,000 contract position (since they are both bullish). On the other
hand, 3,000 long calls and 3,000 long puts would be two separate 3,000
contract positions since one is bullish and one is bearish.
Knopman Note: The CBOE’s position limits rule governs how many
options contracts an investor may control. Exceptions to the standard
position limits are available for 1) delta hedging, 2) firm facilitation, or 3)
market-making. Note: No exception exists for position limits based on
dividends.
It is more important to know the exemptions’ names—and what is not
an exemption—than their application or use.
8.7.3 Exercise Limits
Just as a member firm must reject any order that would cause an account to
exceed a position limit, it must reject any exercise instructions that exceed an
option contract’s exercise limit. The exercise limit provisions restrict the num-
ber of contracts on the same side of the market that an account may exercise
within any five consecutive business days. The number of contracts that may be
exercised in the period is the same as the position limit for that options contract.
This means that if an equity option has a position limit of 250,000 contracts, no
account can deliver exercise instructions for more than 250,000 contracts in any
five consecutive business days.
8.8 Options Contract Adjustments for Splits and Dividends
When the underlying asset in an options contract is subject to a corporate
action, such as a stock split or dividend, the options contracts on those assets
are adjusted by the OCC so that the investor’s exposure remains the same. This
discussion will review adjustments for forward even splits, forward odd splits,
reverse splits, and stock dividends.
8.8.1 Forward Even Splits
A stock split usually takes place when share prices have reached levels that are too
high to attract investor interest or are significantly higher than those of other com-
panies in the same sector. Companies use splits to make shares seem more afford-
able to investors even though the underlying value of the company does not change.
An even split provides a multiple of new shares for each single share previously
owned. For example, after a 2:1 split, investors will have two shares for each single
share they previously owned; in a 4:1 split, investors will have four shares for each
single share they previously owned.
Knopman Note: The key to successfully adjusting options contracts for
splits or stock dividends is to make sure that the investor’s total contract
value is the same before and after the split. The adjustments do not affect
the premiums nor the expiration dates, though the premiums could be
impacted by trading conditions.

Example: 1 JDM Jan 50 Call at 4
JDM announces a 2:1 split.
Step 1: Determine the total value of the contract by multiplying the strike
price by the number of shares.
100 Shares × 50 = $5,000
Step 2: Increase the number of contracts by the split amount.
In a 2:1 split, one contract of 100 shares becomes two contracts totaling
200 shares.
Step 3: Divide the total contract value by the new number of shares to deter-
mine the adjusted strike price.
$5,000/200 Shares = $25 Strike Price
After the split, there are now 2 JDM Jan 25 calls at 4.

8.8.2 Forward Odd Splits
In an odd split, such as a 3:2 split or 5:4 split, the number of shares after the split
is not a multiple of 100 shares. As a result of an odd split, because there cannot
be a fractional number of contracts, the number of contracts does not change.
Instead, the number of shares in a contract is adjusted.
The process of adjusting is the same. The key concept to remember is that the
total contract value does not change after the split.
Example: 1 JDM Jan 50 Call at 4
JDM announces a 3:2 split.
Step 1: Determine the total value of the contract by multiplying the strike
price by the number of shares.
100 Shares × 50 = $5,000
Step 2: Determine the number of shares in the adjusted contract.
In a 3:2 split, multiply the original number of shares, 100, by three and
divide by two.
300 Shares/2 = 150 Shares
Step 3: Divide the total contract value by the new number of shares to deter-
mine the adjusted strike price.
$5,000/150 Shares = $33.33 Strike Price
After the split, there is now 1 JDM Jan 33.33 call for 150 shares at 4.

Knopman Note: Here are some key points regarding stock splits:
• The value of an option contract remains the same if the underlying
stock splits. For example, the value of an option contract is $500; the
underlying equity has a 5:4 stock split, so the option’s value remains
the same at $500).
•In an odd split, the contract size changes. For example, a 3:2 stock
split means the contract size will increase from 100 shares to 150
shares.
8.8.3 Reverse Split
In a reverse stock split, a company increases the value of its stock by reducing the
number of shares. In many instances this is done to maintain a minimum price
so the stock is not delisted from an exchange.
A reverse split results in fewer shares with more value per share. As with forward
splits, the contract value is the same before and after the split.
Example: 1 JDM Jan 50 Call at 4
JDM announces a reverse 1:10 split.
Step 1: Determine the total value of the contract by multiplying the strike
price by the number of shares.
100 Shares × 50 = $5,000
Step 2: Determine the number of shares in the adjusted contract.
In a 1:10 split, divide the original number of shares, 100, by 10.
100 Shares/10 = 10 Shares
Step 3: Divide the total contract value by the new number of shares to deter-
mine the adjusted strike price.
$5,000/10 Shares = $500 Strike Price
After the split, there is now 1 JDM Jan 500 call for 10 shares at 4.
8.8.4 Stock Dividends
At times corporations pay dividends to shareholders in additional shares of stock
rather than in cash. If a company announces a stock dividend, each shareholder
will receive an additional fractional share for each share currently held. As before,
the total contract value does not change.
The same adjustment process used for odd splits can be applied to stock dividends.
Example 1: JDM Jan 50 Call at 4
JDM announces a 5% stock dividend.
Step 1: Determine the total value of the contract by multiplying the strike
price by the number of shares.
100 Shares × 50 = $5,000
Step 2: Increase the number of shares by the dividend amount.
In a 5% stock dividend, each contract’s size is increased by 5%.
Each 100-share contract becomes a contract for 105 shares.
Step 3: Divide the total contract value by the new number of shares to deter-
mine the adjusted strike price.
$5,000/105 Shares = $47.62 Strike Price
After the split, there is now 1 JDM Jan 47.62 call for 105 shares at 4.
Knopman Note: Remember, new options contracts are created only
when shares increase by a multiple of 100.
8.9 Unique Options Order Types
In addition to traditional market and limit orders, the options market offers
other types of orders. These are available for execution on virtually all options
exchanges. The orders are defined under CBOE Rule 6.53.
Knopman Note: Under CBOE rules, a floor broker is an individual who
accepts and executes orders while physically on the floor of the exchange.
Floor brokers can accept and execute orders from registered broker-
dealers and trading permit holders; they cannot accept orders from any
other source.
8.9.1 Contingency Orders
Options traders can enter orders that are dependent on the price of the underlying
equity security. These are called contingency orders. They are so named because
their execution is contingent on the last reported price of the underlying security
on the primary exchange (e.g., NYSE). Stop orders, stop limit orders, market-if-
touched orders, and market-on-close orders are examples of contingency orders.
Knopman Note: Contingency orders are executed based on the last sale
price of the underlying security on the primary exchange. If that price
is later determined to be erroneous, the contingency trade will not be
altered unless mutually agreed to by the parties to the trade.

8.9.2 One-Cancels-the-Other Orders
A one-cancels-the-other (OCO) order consists of two or more orders treated
as a unit. If one of the orders is executed, all remaining orders are cancelled. An
OCO order is also referred to as a stipulation order.
Example
A trader enters two limit orders:
1. Buy 10 Jan 70 calls at 3, or
2. Buy 10 Jan 60 puts at 2, OCO
If the calls are purchased, the put order is cancelled, and if the puts are pur-
chased, the call order is cancelled.
8.9.3 Not Held Orders
Not held orders permit floor brokers to decide the time and price at which to
execute a customer’s order. All orders given to floor brokers are defined as not
held orders unless otherwise specified. When accepting these orders, firms may
mark the order ticket as a “take time” order. A note held order does not give dis-
cretion over the action (buy or sell), quantity, or specific security.
Knopman Note: All orders given to floor brokers are defined as not held
orders unless otherwise specified.
8.9.4 Time-in-Force Orders
The following order types function in the same manner in the options markets
as they do in the equity markets.

    chooses to publish daily trading volume for transactions in its ATS must
    base such volume solely on transactions reported by the ATS dark pool to
    the TRF.

13) The time of execution of an OTC equity trade is reported as
    4:00:00:004 PM. When must the trade be reported and what modifier
    must be used, assuming it is reported on time?
     A) within 30 seconds, .T
     B) by 8:15 am the next morning, .U
     C) within 10 seconds, .U
     D) within 10 seconds, .T
    Answer Explanation:
    This trade took place 4 milliseconds after the close of normal market
    hours. Note that without the millisecond digits, the trade would appear to
    be executed during normal market hours (i.e. at the close). However, in
    this case it is executed outside normal market hours but before 8:00 pm
    so it must be reported within 10 seconds because the trade reporting
    system is still open. If the report is timely (within the 10 seconds), the
    modifier is .T, if it was late, it would include a .U modifier.

     C) The same as the prevailing market price
     D) Below the prevailing market price

    reported trade price. For example, a customer sells 100 shares of ABC to
    broker dealer B at $10.00 inclusive of a $0.15 markdown. The trade report
    would indicate a price of $10.15.

    Trail System (COATS), to provide an accurate, time-sequences record of
