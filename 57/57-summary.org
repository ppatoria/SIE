** Examples of active and passive broker-dealers:

|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------|

|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------|

* Broker-Dealers
** Broker (Book-A)
*** Routes the Order to the liquidity provider, i.e., Interstate Bank or Market Maker
*** Commission is the income
*** STP/ECN
*** fixed spread
** Market Maker (Book-B)
*** In-house match
*** Spread is the income
*** Dealing desk
*** floating spread
*** fastest execution (as the Order is matched in-house and does not need to route to market)

* Order Flow
in case Broker-Dealer maintains both Book-A and Book-B, i.e., it is both Broker as well as market maker
** Receives Order
*** QUANT team determines if it is profitable to match in-house
**** If profitable, act as Market Maker and enter the Order in Book-B
**** Else act as Broker and enter the Order in Book-A

* ECN vs. STP
|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                    | ECN Brokers                                                                                                                         | STP Brokers                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Order routing      | Order is routed straight through to the central interbank market and is filled at the best market rate with no dealer intervention. | Order is routed directly to a counterparty that might be the interbank market, another STP broker, a market maker, or even an ECN broker. |
| Speed of execution | An ECN broker executes trades over the ECN for potential investors, which results in the lowest execution time.                     | The Speed of execution depends on the exact route it takes on specific orders.                                                          |
| Fee structure      | Always charges a small commission for trades and always has variable spreads.                                                       | Can charge commissions and also earn from the spreads. STP can offer variable and fixed spreads.                                        |

* Example of how a straddle options trading strategy might work in real life.

Let's say a trader expects that a particular company's stock is going to experience significant price movement in the near future,
but isn't sure which direction the stock will move.
The Trader decides to use a straddle strategy to try to profit from the potential price movement, regardless of whether the stock goes up or down.
The Trader buys a call option and a put option on the same underlying security with the same expiration date and strike price.
Let's say the stock is currently trading at $50 per share, and the Trader buys a call option and a put option with a strike price of $50
and an expiration date of three months from now. The call option gives the Trader the right to buy the stock at $50 per share,
while the put option gives the Trader the right to sell the stock at $50 per share. If the stock price goes up significantly,
the Trader can exercise the call option and buy the stock at $50 per share, then sell it on the open market at the higher price for a profit.
If the stock price goes down significantly, the Trader can exercise the put option and sell the stock at $50 per share, then buy it back
on the open market at the lower price for a profit.
However, if the stock price remains relatively stable and does not move significantly, the Trader may lose the premium paid for the options.
Overall, the straddle strategy is designed to profit from significant price movements in the underlying security, regardless of whether the price
moves up or down. It allows the Trader to hedge against uncertainty and potential losses in a volatile market.
It's important to note that options trading can be complex and carries significant risk. Before using a straddle or any other options trading
strategy, traders should carefully consider their investment objectives, risk tolerance, and the potential costs and benefits of the strategy.

During the 15-second halt following a Level 1 or Level 2 halt,
the NYSE will conduct a review of the trading data to ensure
that the halt was triggered by legitimate market activity and
not erroneous or manipulative trading. 

If the NYSE determines that the halt was triggered by legitimate market activity, trading will resume after the 15-second period. 
If the NYSE determines that the halt was triggered by erroneous or manipulative activity, the affected trades may be canceled, or the trading halt may be extended.

|                                              | that have resulted in trades being executed at prices that are significantly        |
|                                              | different from the prevailing market prices.                                        |
|----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Example                                      | XYZ Corp was trading at around $50 per share, but due to a technical glitch,        |
|                                              | a large institutional investor buys 10,000 shares at $100 per share.                |
|                                              | This leads to other traders buying at $80 per share, resulting in many trades       |
|                                              | at prices that deviated significantly from the prevailing market price.             |
|                                              | FINRA may declare a multi-day event for clearly erroneous trades in this situation. |

|                                              | erroneous trades, It must declare the event no later than the start of trading on   |
|                                              | Thursday. This allows market participants to adjust their positions and trading     |

|                                              | trading on Thursday. However, it is generally considered better practice to declare |

In the context of short selling, an "open-fail position" occurs when a short seller is unable to deliver the securities they have contracted to sell by the settlement date. This can happen if the short seller cannot locate the securities to borrow or if there is a problem with the delivery process.

* Summary of the different types of short sale positions:
|-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Short Sale Position   | Description                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Open short position   | The short seller has sold securities they have borrowed and has not yet closed the position by buying back the securities. |
| Closed short position | The short seller has bought back the securities they borrowed and has closed the position.                                 |
| Open-long position    | The investor has bought securities and has not yet sold them.                                                              |
| Closed-long position  | The investor has sold the securities they bought and has closed the position.                                              |
| Open-fail position    | The short seller has failed to deliver the securities they contracted to sell by the settlement date.                      |
|-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


* State diagram illustrating the positions and transitions:

An *Open-Short* Position can transition to a *Closed-Short* Position when the short position is closed.
A *Closed-Short* Position can transition to an *Open-Fail* Position if the delivery of securities fails.
An *Open-Fail* Position can transition back to a *Closed-Short* Position if the failure to deliver is resolved or closed.
