** Examples of active and passive broker-dealers:
Active broker-dealers:
- Goldman Sachs
- JPMorgan Chase
- Morgan Stanley
- Citigroup
- Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Passive broker-dealers:

It's worth noting that some broker-dealers may engage in both active and passive activities, depending on the situation.
For example, a broker-dealer may act as a market maker for certain securities while also executing trades on behalf of clients.

|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------|
| Feature        | Competitive Bids                                                      | Independent Bids |

| Requested by   | The investor                                                          | N/A              |
| Solicitation   | Obtained from multiple broker-dealers                                 | N/A              |
| Source of bids | Multiple broker-dealers                                               | N/A              |

|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------|

* Broker-Dealers
** Broker (Book-A)
*** Routes the Order to the liquidity provider, i.e., Interstate Bank or Market Maker
*** Commission is the income
*** STP/ECN
*** fixed spread
** Market Maker (Book-B)
*** In-house match
*** Spread is the income
*** Dealing desk
*** floating spread
*** fastest execution (as the Order is matched in-house and does not need to route to market)

* Order Flow
in case Broker-Dealer maintains both Book-A and Book-B, i.e., it is both Broker as well as market maker
** Receives Order
*** QUANT team determines if it is profitable to match in-house
**** If profitable, act as Market Maker and enter the Order in Book-B
**** Else act as Broker and enter the Order in Book-A

* ECN vs. STP
|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                    | ECN Brokers                                                                                                                         | STP Brokers                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Order routing      | Order is routed straight through to the central interbank market and is filled at the best market rate with no dealer intervention. | Order is routed directly to a counterparty that might be the interbank market, another STP broker, a market maker, or even an ECN broker. |
| Speed of execution | An ECN broker executes trades over the ECN for potential investors, which results in the lowest execution time.                     | The Speed of execution depends on the exact route it takes on specific orders.                                                          |
| Fee structure      | Always charges a small commission for trades and always has variable spreads.                                                       | Can charge commissions and also earn from the spreads. STP can offer variable and fixed spreads.                                        |

* Example of how a straddle options trading strategy might work in real life.

Let's say a trader expects that a particular company's stock is going to experience significant price movement in the near future,
but isn't sure which direction the stock will move.
The Trader decides to use a straddle strategy to try to profit from the potential price movement, regardless of whether the stock goes up or down.
The Trader buys a call option and a put option on the same underlying security with the same expiration date and strike price.
Let's say the stock is currently trading at $50 per share, and the Trader buys a call option and a put option with a strike price of $50
and an expiration date of three months from now. The call option gives the Trader the right to buy the stock at $50 per share,
while the put option gives the Trader the right to sell the stock at $50 per share. If the stock price goes up significantly,
the Trader can exercise the call option and buy the stock at $50 per share, then sell it on the open market at the higher price for a profit.
If the stock price goes down significantly, the Trader can exercise the put option and sell the stock at $50 per share, then buy it back
on the open market at the lower price for a profit.
However, if the stock price remains relatively stable and does not move significantly, the Trader may lose the premium paid for the options.
Overall, the straddle strategy is designed to profit from significant price movements in the underlying security, regardless of whether the price
moves up or down. It allows the Trader to hedge against uncertainty and potential losses in a volatile market.
It's important to note that options trading can be complex and carries significant risk. Before using a straddle or any other options trading
strategy, traders should carefully consider their investment objectives, risk tolerance, and the potential costs and benefits of the strategy.

During the 15-second halt following a Level 1 or Level 2 halt,
the NYSE will conduct a review of the trading data to ensure
that the halt was triggered by legitimate market activity and
not erroneous or manipulative trading. 

If the NYSE determines that the halt was triggered by legitimate market activity, trading will resume after the 15-second period. 
If the NYSE determines that the halt was triggered by erroneous or manipulative activity, the affected trades may be canceled, or the trading halt may be extended.

|                                              | that have resulted in trades being executed at prices that are significantly        |
|                                              | different from the prevailing market prices.                                        |
|----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Example                                      | XYZ Corp was trading at around $50 per share, but due to a technical glitch,        |
|                                              | a large institutional investor buys 10,000 shares at $100 per share.                |
|                                              | This leads to other traders buying at $80 per share, resulting in many trades       |
|                                              | at prices that deviated significantly from the prevailing market price.             |
|                                              | FINRA may declare a multi-day event for clearly erroneous trades in this situation. |

|                                              | erroneous trades, It must declare the event no later than the start of trading on   |
|                                              | Thursday. This allows market participants to adjust their positions and trading     |

|                                              | trading on Thursday. However, it is generally considered better practice to declare |

In the context of short selling, an "open-fail position" occurs when a short seller is unable to deliver the securities they have contracted to sell by the settlement date. This can happen if the short seller cannot locate the securities to borrow or if there is a problem with the delivery process.

* Summary of the different types of short sale positions:
|-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Short Sale Position   | Description                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Open short position   | The short seller has sold securities they have borrowed and has not yet closed the position by buying back the securities. |
| Closed short position | The short seller has bought back the securities they borrowed and has closed the position.                                 |
| Open-long position    | The investor has bought securities and has not yet sold them.                                                              |
| Closed-long position  | The investor has sold the securities they bought and has closed the position.                                              |
| Open-fail position    | The short seller has failed to deliver the securities they contracted to sell by the settlement date.                      |
|-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


* State diagram illustrating the positions and transitions:

An *Open-Short* Position can transition to a *Closed-Short* Position when the short position is closed.
A *Closed-Short* Position can transition to an *Open-Fail* Position if the delivery of securities fails.
An *Open-Fail* Position can transition back to a *Closed-Short* Position if the failure to deliver is resolved or closed.

|             | Market makers are firms that are obligated to maintain continuous trading in a security.                  |
|             | They do this by buying and selling the security at the best available prices.                             |
|             | Trades that are executed by market makers are exempt from the trading volume thresholds                   |
|             | because they are necessary to ensure that there is always liquidity in the market.                        |

|             | Trades that are executed in response to an order from a customer are also exempt                          |
|             | from the trading volume thresholds. This is because customers should be able to trade securities          |
|             | without being subject to the trading volume thresholds.                                                   |
|             |                                                                                                           |

|             | are also exempt from the trading volume thresholds. This is because these types                           |
|             | of transactions are typically large and negotiated transactions, and                                      |
|             | the trading volume thresholds would not be effective in preventing market manipulation in these cases.    |
|             |                                                                                                           |

| **Net Order Imbalance Indicator (NOII)** | A measure of the imbalance between the number of buy and sell orders for a security. It is calculated by taking the total number of buy orders for a security and subtracting the total number of sell orders for that security. A positive NOII indicates that there are more buy orders than sell orders, while a negative NOII indicates that there are more sell orders than buy orders. | NOII = Buy Orders - Sell Orders | Identify stocks that are likely to experience a price move. | NOII is just one indicator of a stock's price movement. Other factors, such as company earnings, economic news, and political events, can also affect a stock's price. | **A positive NOII indicates that there is strong buying pressure on a stock, which could lead to a price increase. A negative NOII indicates that there is strong selling pressure on a stock, which could lead to a price decrease.** | **Institutional investors, hedge funds, and day traders** | **NOII can be used to identify stocks that are likely to experience a price move. It can also be used to confirm other technical indicators, such as moving averages and support and resistance levels.** |

** NOII is used by a variety of investors,including
    - institutional investors,
    - hedge funds, and
    - day traders.
      It is a valuable tool for identifying stocks that are likely to experience a price move.

** NOII is a lagging indicator,
    - which means that it measures the imbalance between buy and sell orders that have already been placed.
      This means that NOII can be used to confirm a price move that has already happened,
      but it cannot be used to predict a future price move.
** NOII is not always accurate.
    - There are times when NOII may indicate a price move that does not happen.
      This is because NOII is just one indicator of a stock's price movement,
      and other factors can also affect a stock's price.

Here is an example of how the steps above are applied:

** There are 100 buy orders and 50 sell orders for a security.
** The NOII is therefore 50.
** There is more buying pressure than selling pressure, so the supply and demand factor is +10%.
** The reference price is $3.33.
** The adjusted reference price is $3.66.
** The adjusted reference price is within the allowed range.
** The opening or closing price is set at $3.66.


* To understand how opening and closing prices are calculated and
* how the imbalance indicators such as NOII (Net Order Imbalance Indicator) and
* unpaired shares are used to determine the reference price,
* let's go through the process step by step:

1. Pre-Market Phase:
   - During the pre-market phase, before regular trading hours, traders can submit orders to buy or sell securities.
   - The exchange calculates the NOII based on the orders received during this phase.
     The NOII represents the net order imbalance, indicating the difference between buy and sell orders.

2. Auction Phase:
   - The auction phase occurs immediately before the market opens.
   - The exchange calculates the reference price based on the NOII and the unpaired shares.

3. Calculation of Reference Price:
   - The reference price is determined to facilitate the opening auction process.
     It aims to find a price at which the maximum number of shares can be matched.
   - The exchange considers the following factors:
     - Buy Imbalance: The total quantity of buy orders in the NOII.
     - Sell Imbalance: The total quantity of sell orders in the NOII.
     - Unpaired Shares: The remaining shares that could not be matched based on the buy and sell orders in the NOII.
   - The reference price is calculated to minimize the imbalance between buy and sell orders and
     maximize the number of matched shares.

4. Opening Auction:
   - The opening auction occurs after the reference price is determined.
   - Orders placed during the pre-market phase are matched at or within a specified range around the reference price.
   - The exchange executes the trades at the opening price,
     which is the price at which the maximum number of shares can be matched.

5. Opening Price:
   - The opening price is the price at which the trades are executed during the opening auction.
   - It is calculated based on the matching algorithm of the exchange,
     taking into account the order flow and the reference price.

6. Regular Trading Hours:
   - Once the market is open, securities can be traded throughout the regular trading hours.
   - The price of each trade is determined by the supply and demand dynamics in the market,
     with buyers and sellers agreeing on a price for each transaction.

7. Closing Auction:
   - At the end of the trading day, a closing auction takes place to establish the closing price.
   - Similar to the opening auction, buy and sell orders are matched, and the exchange determines a closing reference price.
   - Orders placed during the regular trading hours are matched at or
     within a specified range around the closing reference price.
   - The trades executed during the closing auction contribute to determining the closing price.

8. Closing Price:
   - The closing price is the final price at which the trades are executed during the closing auction.
   - It represents the last traded price for the day and
     is often used as a reference for performance measurement.

Regulations and exchange rules:
- The specific rules and regulations governing the calculation of opening and closing prices,
  as well as the use of imbalance indicators, may vary depending on the exchange and jurisdiction.
- Each exchange has its own set of rules that govern the opening and closing auction processes,
  including how the reference price is determined and the trading rules during these periods.
- Regulatory bodies such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in the United States may
  provide guidelines and oversight to ensure fair and orderly markets.

It's important to note that the precise calculations and rules for opening and closing prices
can be complex and vary across different exchanges and markets.
The examples provided here are simplified explanations to help understand the general concept.
For specific details and accurate calculations,
it's advisable to refer to the rules and regulations of the relevant exchange or consult official sources.
