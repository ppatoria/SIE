**** Examples of active and passive broker-dealers:
Active broker-dealers:
- Goldman Sachs
- JPMorgan Chase
- Morgan Stanley
- Citigroup
- Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Passive broker-dealers:
- Charles Schwab
- TD Ameritrade
- E*TRADE
- Robinhood
- Interactive Brokers

It's worth noting that some broker-dealers may engage in both active and passive activities, depending on the situation.
For example, a broker-dealer may act as a market maker for certain securities while also executing trades on behalf of clients.

** Difference between Broker Dealer and Market Maker
*** Broker (Book-A)
**** Routes the Order to the liquidity provider, i.e., Interstate Bank or Market Maker
**** Commission is the income
**** STP/ECN
**** fixed spread
*** Market Maker (Book-B)
**** In-house match
**** Spread is the income
**** Dealing desk
**** floating spread
**** fastest execution (as the Order is matched in-house and does not need to route to market)

*** Broker as well as Market Maker (Order Flow)
in case Broker-Dealer maintains both Book-A and Book-B, i.e., it is both Broker as well as market maker
**** Receives Order
***** QUANT team determines if it is profitable to match in-house
****** If profitable, act as Market Maker and enter the Order in Book-B
****** Else act as Broker and enter the Order in Book-A

* Closeout /settlement
In the context of security trading, closeout/settlement refers to the process of settling a trade by delivering securities and receiving payment. 
** Short Sale : T + 3  (before open)
The seller must deliver the securities by the third business day after the sale.
** Long Sale  : T + 5  (before open)
The seller must deliver the securities by the fifth business day after the sale.
** Threshold: T + 14 (before opening)
If a security fails to settle for 14 consecutive days, it will appear on the threshold list.

* Risk Control
** Pre-Trade Control: Automated control for automated trading system.
Pre-trade controls are automated controls for automated trading systems that are designed to prevent erroneous orders from entering the market.
These controls include direct market access (DMA) controls that are designed to prevent the routing of a market order based on impact at unreasonable levels. 
** If BD provides DMA: The control should be direct and exclusive (no out-sourcing allowed)
DMA is a type of electronic trading that allows traders to access markets directly without the need for a broker.
DMA is used by institutional investors and hedge funds to trade large volumes of securities.
DMA allows traders to execute trades faster and more efficiently than traditional trading methods.
When a broker-dealer provides direct market access (DMA), the control should be direct and exclusive,
which means that the broker-dealer should not outsource the control.
This means that the broker-dealer should not delegate the responsibility of risk control to a third party.

* Example of how a straddle options trading strategy might work in real life.

Let's say a trader expects that a particular company's stock is going to experience significant price movement in the near future,
but isn't sure which direction the stock will move.
The Trader decides to use a straddle strategy to try to profit from the potential price movement, regardless of whether the stock goes up or down.
The Trader buys a call option and a put option on the same underlying security with the same expiration date and strike price.
Let's say the stock is currently trading at $50 per share, and the Trader buys a call option and a put option with a strike price of $50
and an expiration date of three months from now. The call option gives the Trader the right to buy the stock at $50 per share,
while the put option gives the Trader the right to sell the stock at $50 per share. If the stock price goes up significantly,
the Trader can exercise the call option and buy the stock at $50 per share, then sell it on the open market at the higher price for a profit.
If the stock price goes down significantly, the Trader can exercise the put option and sell the stock at $50 per share, then buy it back
on the open market at the lower price for a profit.
However, if the stock price remains relatively stable and does not move significantly, the Trader may lose the premium paid for the options.
Overall, the straddle strategy is designed to profit from significant price movements in the underlying security, regardless of whether the price
moves up or down. It allows the Trader to hedge against uncertainty and potential losses in a volatile market.
It's important to note that options trading can be complex and carries significant risk. Before using a straddle or any other options trading
strategy, traders should carefully consider their investment objectives, risk tolerance, and the potential costs and benefits of the strategy.

During the 15-second halt following a Level 1 or Level 2 halt,
the NYSE will conduct a review of the trading data to ensure
that the halt was triggered by legitimate market activity and
not erroneous or manipulative trading. 

If the NYSE determines that the halt was triggered by legitimate market activity, trading will resume after the 15-second period. 
If the NYSE determines that the halt was triggered by erroneous or manipulative activity, the affected trades may be canceled, or the trading halt may be extended.

|                                              | that have resulted in trades being executed at prices that are significantly        |
|                                              | different from the prevailing market prices.                                        |
|----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Example                                      | XYZ Corp was trading at around $50 per share, but due to a technical glitch,        |
|                                              | a large institutional investor buys 10,000 shares at $100 per share.                |
|                                              | This leads to other traders buying at $80 per share, resulting in many trades       |
|                                              | at prices that deviated significantly from the prevailing market price.             |
|                                              | FINRA may declare a multi-day event for clearly erroneous trades in this situation. |

|                                              | erroneous trades, It must declare the event no later than the start of trading on   |
|                                              | Thursday. This allows market participants to adjust their positions and trading     |

|                                              | trading on Thursday. However, it is generally considered better practice to declare |

** Reference Price and Bands Determination:
   - The exchange calculates the reference price, which is the five-minute moving average of the security's last sales price.
   - LULD bands are set based on the reference price:
   -- For Tier 1 securities (e.g., S&P 500), the bands are 5% (10% at open/close).
   -- For Tier 2 securities (all other NMS stocks), the bands are 10% (20% at open/close).
   -- For securities priced under $0.75, the bands are the lesser of $0.15 or 75% (doubled at open/close).

** Limit State:
   - If a quote is entered that moves the national best offer price to the lower band or the national best bid price to the upper band without crossing the market, a 15-second limit state begins.
   - Trading can continue within the band during this time.
   - The limit state ends if the quote causing it is executed, canceled, or modified.
   - If the national best bid or offer remains at the band for 15 seconds, a five-minute trading halt begins.

** LULD Halts Sequence:
   - An initial halt occurs if a security enters a limit state.
   - During the five-minute volatility trading pause, no trading may occur, but quotes can be updated, and orders can be accepted.
   - The halt can end after the mandatory five minutes when the primary market reports a re-opening price.
   - If the issue causing the halt is not resolved, subsequent halts may occur in response to further limit state triggers.

** Subsequent Halts:
   - If the same issue persists and triggers another limit state after the initial halt ends, a new five-minute trading halt begins.
   - Subsequent halts can repeat if the issue continues.

** Conclusion If Not Resolved:
   - If the issue causing the halt is not resolved after multiple halts, the security may remain halted for an extended period.
   - The exchange, in conjunction with regulatory bodies like the SEC, may investigate the issue and determine appropriate actions to resolve it.

* Straddle State
** Under LULD, a security is in a straddle state if the bid and offer are on either side of the price band.
** Under a straddle state, the exchange will monitor conditions and implement a pause for anything abnormal.
** Example:
    The reference price for an S&P 500 stock is $50.
    Therefore, the 5% band is down to 47.50 and up to 52.50.
    If the NBBO is 52.45–.55, this is a straddle state.

| Scenarios where they occur                                       | Affirmative option is typically used for trading in dark pools, which are private exchanges that allow investors to trade large blocks of shares without impacting the public market. Affirmative option is also used for high-frequency trading, commodity trading, and options trading. | Affirmative opt out is typically used for trading in exchanges, which are public markets where anyone can buy and sell shares.    |
| How they are reported to FINRA                                   | Affirmative option trades must be reported to FINRA by the broker who executed the trade.                                         | Affirmative opt out trades do not need to be reported to FINRA.                                                                   |
| Regulations that need to be followed in case of Dark Moon        | In the case of Dark Moon, which is a dark pool operated by Goldman Sachs, FINRA requires that all affirmative option trades be reported within 15 minutes of execution. | FINRA does not have any specific regulations governing affirmative opt out trades.                                                |
| What happens if it's not timely reported or if it's not reported | If an affirmative option trade is not timely reported to FINRA, the broker who executed the trade may be subject to fines and other penalties. | If an affirmative opt out trade is not reported to FINRA, there are no specific penalties. However, FINRA may investigate the matter and take action if it believes that the trade was not executed in accordance with the rules. |

| Regulations | Exchanges and FINRA have trading volume thresholds that are designed to prevent market manipulation and   |
|             | ensure that all investors have access to fair and orderly markets.                                        |
|             | FINRA's threshold contract trading rules require that all threshold contracts                             |
|             | be traded on a national securities exchange or through a registered broker-dealer.                        |
|             |                                                                                                           |

| Exceptions  | There are a number of exceptions to the trading volume thresholds, including:                             |
|             | * Trades that are executed by market makers                                                               |
|             | * Trades that are executed in response to an order from a customer                                        |
|             | * Trades that are executed in connection with an underwriting or secondary offering                       |
|             | * Trades that are executed for hedging purposes                                                           |
|             | * Trades that are executed for arbitrage purposes                                                         |
|             | * Trades that are executed by large institutions                                                          |
|             |                                                                                                           |
| Penalty     | If a trading volume threshold is exceeded, the exchange or FINRA may take a number of actions, including: |
| or          | * Suspending trading in the security or contract                                                          |
| Actions     | * Investigating the matter to determine if there was any market manipulation                              |
|             | * Taking disciplinary action against any individuals or firms who were involved in the violation          |

|             | * Fines                                                                                                   |
|             | * Suspension or expulsion from FINRA                                                                      |
|             | * Criminal prosecution                                                                                    |
|             |                                                                                                           |
| Exceptions  | * **Market makers:**                                                                                      |
|             | Market makers are firms that are obligated to maintain continuous trading in a security.                  |
|             | They do this by buying and selling the security at the best available prices.                             |
|             | Trades that are executed by market makers are exempt from the trading volume thresholds                   |
|             | because they are necessary to ensure that there is always liquidity in the market.                        |
|             |                                                                                                           |
|             | * **Customer orders:**                                                                                    |
|             | Trades that are executed in response to an order from a customer are also exempt                          |
|             | from the trading volume thresholds. This is because customers should be able to trade securities          |
|             | without being subject to the trading volume thresholds.                                                   |
|             |                                                                                                           |
|             | * **Underwritings and secondary offerings:**                                                              |
|             | Trades that are executed in connection with an underwriting or secondary offering                         |
|             | are also exempt from the trading volume thresholds. This is because these types                           |
|             | of transactions are typically large and negotiated transactions, and                                      |
|             | the trading volume thresholds would not be effective in preventing market manipulation in these cases.    |
|             |                                                                                                           |
|             | * **Hedging and arbitrage:**                                                                              |
|             | Trades that are executed for hedging or arbitrage purposes are also exempt                                |
|             | from the trading volume thresholds. Hedging is a risk management strategy that involves                   |
|             | taking offsetting positions in different securities. Arbitrage is a trading strategy that                 |
|             | involves buying and selling the same security in different markets to profit from a price difference.     |
|             |                                                                                                           |
|             | * **Large institutions:**                                                                                 |
|             | Trades that are executed by large institutions are also exempt from the trading volume thresholds.        |
|             | This is because large institutions typically have significant resources                                   |
|             | and can make their own decisions about whether or not to trade a security.                                |
|             |                                                                                                           |
| Exchanges   | There are many different exchanges in the world, each with its own rules and regulations.                 |
|             | Some of the largest and most well-known exchanges include:                                                |

|             |                                                                                                           |
|             | These exchanges are all regulated by different organizations,                                             |
|             | but they all have similar goals of providing fair and orderly markets for investors.                      |

| **Net Order Imbalance Indicator (NOII)** | A measure of the imbalance between the number of buy and sell orders for a security. It is calculated by taking the total number of buy orders for a security and subtracting the total number of sell orders for that security. A positive NOII indicates that there are more buy orders than sell orders, while a negative NOII indicates that there are more sell orders than buy orders. | NOII = Buy Orders - Sell Orders | Identify stocks that are likely to experience a price move. | NOII is just one indicator of a stock's price movement. Other factors, such as company earnings, economic news, and political events, can also affect a stock's price. | **A positive NOII indicates that there is strong buying pressure on a stock, which could lead to a price increase. A negative NOII indicates that there is strong selling pressure on a stock, which could lead to a price decrease.** | **Institutional investors, hedge funds, and day traders** | **NOII can be used to identify stocks that are likely to experience a price move. It can also be used to confirm other technical indicators, such as moving averages and support and resistance levels.** |

** NOII is used by a variety of investors,including
    - institutional investors,
    - hedge funds, and
    - day traders.
      It is a valuable tool for identifying stocks that are likely to experience a price move.

** NOII is a lagging indicator,
    - which means that it measures the imbalance between buy and sell orders that have already been placed.
      This means that NOII can be used to confirm a price move that has already happened,
      but it cannot be used to predict a future price move.
** NOII is not always accurate.
    - There are times when NOII may indicate a price move that does not happen.
      This is because NOII is just one indicator of a stock's price movement,
      and other factors can also affect a stock's price.

| **What is it?**                                                                   | A process that determines the opening or closing price for securities listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.                          |

| **How is it calculated?**                                                         | The opening and closing prices are calculated based on the net order imbalance (NOII) for each security. The NOII is calculated by taking the difference between the number of buy orders and the number of sell orders for a security. A positive NOII indicates that there are more buy orders than sell orders, while a negative NOII indicates that there are more sell orders than buy orders. |
| **Detailed example of calculation:**                                              | Let's say that there are 100 buy orders and 50 sell orders for a security. The NOII would be 50, which is positive. This indicates that there is more buying pressure than selling pressure for the security. The market maker would then buy 50 shares at the current market price, which would bring the number of buy orders and sell orders back into balance. The opening price for the security would then be the price at which the market maker bought the 50 shares. |
| **Detailed example of how NOII and unpaired shares are used in the calculation:** | The NOII is used to determine the current reference price, which is the price at which the market maker will buy or sell shares during the opening or closing cross. Unpaired shares are shares that are not matched with a corresponding buy or sell order. Unpaired shares can occur when there is not enough liquidity in the market or when there is a large price difference between the buy and sell orders. When there are unpaired shares, the market maker will use the NOII to calculate the current reference price, and then buy or sell shares at that price until all of the unpaired shares are paired. |
| **Explicit explanation of how NOII calculates the current reference price:**      | The NOII is calculated by taking the difference between the number of buy orders and the number of sell orders for a security. The market maker then uses the NOII to calculate the current reference price, which is the price at which the market maker will buy or sell shares during the opening or closing cross. The current reference price is calculated by dividing the NOII by the total number of shares that are available to be traded. The current reference price is then rounded to the nearest cent. |
| **Example with data:**                                                            | Let's say that there are 100 buy orders and 50 sell orders for a security. The NOII would be 50, which is positive. This indicates that there is more buying pressure than selling pressure for the security. The total number of shares that are available to be traded is 150. The current reference price would then be 3.33, which is calculated by dividing the NOII by the total number of shares that are available to be traded. |

Here is an example of how the steps above are applied:

** There are 100 buy orders and 50 sell orders for a security.
** The NOII is therefore 50.
** There is more buying pressure than selling pressure, so the supply and demand factor is +10%.
** The reference price is $3.33.
** The adjusted reference price is $3.66.
** The adjusted reference price is within the allowed range.
** The opening or closing price is set at $3.66.


* To understand how opening and closing prices are calculated and
* how the imbalance indicators such as NOII (Net Order Imbalance Indicator) and
* unpaired shares are used to determine the reference price,
* let's go through the process step by step:

1. Pre-Market Phase:
   - During the pre-market phase, before regular trading hours, traders can submit orders to buy or sell securities.
   - The exchange calculates the NOII based on the orders received during this phase.
     The NOII represents the net order imbalance, indicating the difference between buy and sell orders.

2. Auction Phase:
   - The auction phase occurs immediately before the market opens.
   - The exchange calculates the reference price based on the NOII and the unpaired shares.

3. Calculation of Reference Price:
   - The reference price is determined to facilitate the opening auction process.
     It aims to find a price at which the maximum number of shares can be matched.
   - The exchange considers the following factors:
     - Buy Imbalance: The total quantity of buy orders in the NOII.
     - Sell Imbalance: The total quantity of sell orders in the NOII.
     - Unpaired Shares: The remaining shares that could not be matched based on the buy and sell orders in the NOII.
   - The reference price is calculated to minimize the imbalance between buy and sell orders and
     maximize the number of matched shares.

4. Opening Auction:
   - The opening auction occurs after the reference price is determined.
   - Orders placed during the pre-market phase are matched at or within a specified range around the reference price.
   - The exchange executes the trades at the opening price,
     which is the price at which the maximum number of shares can be matched.

5. Opening Price:
   - The opening price is the price at which the trades are executed during the opening auction.
   - It is calculated based on the matching algorithm of the exchange,
     taking into account the order flow and the reference price.

6. Regular Trading Hours:
   - Once the market is open, securities can be traded throughout the regular trading hours.
   - The price of each trade is determined by the supply and demand dynamics in the market,
     with buyers and sellers agreeing on a price for each transaction.

7. Closing Auction:
   - At the end of the trading day, a closing auction takes place to establish the closing price.
   - Similar to the opening auction, buy and sell orders are matched, and the exchange determines a closing reference price.
   - Orders placed during the regular trading hours are matched at or
     within a specified range around the closing reference price.
   - The trades executed during the closing auction contribute to determining the closing price.

8. Closing Price:
   - The closing price is the final price at which the trades are executed during the closing auction.
   - It represents the last traded price for the day and
     is often used as a reference for performance measurement.

Regulations and exchange rules:
- The specific rules and regulations governing the calculation of opening and closing prices,
  as well as the use of imbalance indicators, may vary depending on the exchange and jurisdiction.
- Each exchange has its own set of rules that govern the opening and closing auction processes,
  including how the reference price is determined and the trading rules during these periods.
- Regulatory bodies such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in the United States may
  provide guidelines and oversight to ensure fair and orderly markets.

It's important to note that the precise calculations and rules for opening and closing prices
can be complex and vary across different exchanges and markets.
The examples provided here are simplified explanations to help understand the general concept.
For specific details and accurate calculations,
it's advisable to refer to the rules and regulations of the relevant exchange or consult official sources.

* Here is a table that compares five systems or tools for calculating reference and fair price:

| System                   | Fair price calculation                                                                                                            | Factors taken into account                                                                                                 | Features                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NOII and unpaired shares | The fair price is calculated as the mid-point of the best bid and offer prices for unpaired shares.                               | Supply and demand for the security                                                                                         | Simple to implement and less expensive than other systems. Does not provide real-time price updates.                              |
| CAS                      | The fair price is calculated as the average of the best bid and offer prices for all shares that have traded during the opening and closing auctions. | Supply and demand for the security, recent trading history of the security, and current market conditions.                 | More accurate than the NOII and unpaired shares system, but more complex and expensive to implement. Provides real-time price updates. |
| ETOS                     | The fair price is calculated as the best price available for the security at the time the order is placed.                        | Supply and demand for the security, recent trading history of the security, and current market conditions.                 | Most accurate and efficient system, but also the most complex and expensive to implement. Provides real-time price updates, allows for market orders, and allows for stop-loss orders. |
| TOBP                     | The fair price is calculated as the best price available for the security after taking into account the order book, the recent trading history of the security, and the current market conditions. | Supply and demand for the security, recent trading history of the security, current market conditions, and the order book. | The most accurate system available, but also the most complex and expensive to implement.

** Question:what is T and P modifier in context of security tradings ? Please refer the book I provided for the answer.

*** Answer:
The T and P modifiers are used in the context of security trading to indicate the time of execution of a trade. The T modifier indicates that the trade was executed during after-hours trading, while the P modifier indicates that the trade was executed at a prior reference price.

The book you provided, Series 57 Exam - Mastering Trade Reporting, defines the T modifier as follows:

T - After Hours Trade. This modifier is used to indicate that the trade was executed outside of normal market hours.

The book defines the P modifier as follows:

P - Prior Reference Price. This modifier is used to indicate that the trade was executed at a price that was previously agreed upon by the parties involved in the trade.

For example, if a trade is reported with the T modifier, it means that the trade was executed after the close of regular market hours. If a trade is reported with the P modifier, it means that the trade was executed at a price that was previously agreed upon by the parties involved in the trade.

** Question: 
 A customer enters an order to buy 600 shares of stock at 2:46 p.m. Due to an error, the trade does not execute until almost an hour later, at 3:44 p.m. The trade report will indicate
 A) the actual execution price along with a .T modifier.
 B) the price that prevailed at 2:46 along with a .P modifier.
 C) the actual execution price along with a .P modifier.
 D) the price that prevailed at 2:46 along with a .T modifier.

*** Answer: The answer is C) the actual execution price along with a .P modifier.

The P modifier indicates that the trade was executed at a prior reference price, which in this case is the price that prevailed at 2:46 p.m. The T modifier would only be used if the trade was executed during after-hours trading. Since the trade was executed during regular market hours, the P modifier is used.

So the trade report will indicate the actual execution price of the trade, which was 3:44 p.m., along with the P modifier. This will indicate to other market participants that the trade was executed at a price that was previously agreed upon by the parties involved in the trade.

The Symbol column shows the ticker symbol of the stock that was traded. The Quantity column shows the number of shares that were traded. The Price column shows the price at which the trade was executed. The Date column shows the date of the trade. The Time column shows the time of the trade. The Modifier column shows the P modifier, which indicates that the trade was executed at a prior reference price.

In this example, the trade was executed at 14:44 on 2023-06-24. However, the P modifier indicates that the trade was executed at a price that was previously agreed upon by the parties involved in the trade. This means that the trade was not executed at the market price that prevailed at 14:44.





|Modifier	|Meaning	|Price on Display	|After-Hours Trading|	Actual Price|
T	After-hours trade	Actual price at time of execution	Yes	Price at time of execution
P	Prior reference price	Actual price at time of execution	No	Price agreed upon by parties involved
W	Weighted average price	Weighted average price of all trades in the same security	Yes	Weighted average price of all trades in the same security
X	Negotiated trade	Actual price at time of execution	No	Actual price at time of execution
Y	Intermarket sweep order	Actual price at time of execution	No	Actual price at time of execution
Z	Crossing network trade	Actual price at time of execution	No	Actual price at time of execution
As I mentioned before, the P modifier does not specify which price was used, so the actual price on the trade report could be either the price at 2:46 or the price at 3:44. In practice, the price that is used for the trade report is usually the price that prevailed at the time of execution. However, there is no requirement for this, and the parties involved in the trade could have agreed to use a different price.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

W	Weighted average price	Weighted average price of all trades in the same security	Yes	Weighted average price of all trades in the same security	A trade executed as part of a block trade, where the price is the weighted average price of all the shares in the block
X	Negotiated trade	Actual price at time of execution	No	Actual price at time of execution	A trade executed between two parties who have agreed upon a price

Z	Crossing network trade	Actual price at time of execution	No	Actual price at time of execution	A trade executed as part of a crossing network trade, where the price is the price at which the order is crossed

what is Intermarket sweep order?

An intermarket sweep order (ISO) is a type of order that allows a trader to buy or sell a large quantity of shares across multiple markets simultaneously. This type of order is designed to take advantage of price differences between different markets and to ensure that the trader gets the best possible price for their shares.

ISOs are exempt from the "trade-through" rule, which means that they can be executed even if there are better prices available on other markets. This exemption allows ISOs to be used to quickly and efficiently take liquidity from the market, which can be beneficial for both traders and market makers.

Here is how an ISO works:

A trader submits an ISO to their broker.
The broker sends the ISO to the exchanges that are participating in the order.
The exchanges match the ISO against the best available prices on their respective markets.
The ISO is executed at the best available price across all markets.
ISOs are typically used by large institutional traders, such as hedge funds and investment banks. These traders often need to buy or sell large quantities of shares, and ISOs can help them to get the best possible price for their trades.

Here are some of the advantages of using ISOs:

They can help traders to get the best possible price for their trades.
They can be used to quickly and efficiently take liquidity from the market.
They are exempt from the "trade-through" rule.
Here are some of the disadvantages of using ISOs:

They can be expensive to execute.
They can only be used by large institutional traders.
They can disrupt the market if they are used too frequently.
Overall, ISOs can be a useful tool for traders who need to buy or sell large quantities of shares. However, they should be used with caution, as they can be expensive and can disrupt the market.

correct me from
but as per the regulation
of the nms
displays
the best burden offer
from all the exchanges
I need to say it's already provided
as for the rule and regulation by SEC or finra
why ISO is required
I may be wrong please correct me from

Sure, I can help you with that.

You are correct that the National Market System (NMS) displays the best burden offer from all the exchanges. This means that traders can see the best price available for a particular security across all the different markets. However, there are a few reasons why ISOs are still required.

First, the NMS only displays the best burden offer for the top of the book. This means that if there are multiple orders at the best price, the NMS will only display the first order. ISOs can be used to sweep through the entire book and get the best possible price for a large quantity of shares.

Second, the NMS does not display all the different markets that are participating in the order. This means that a trader may not be able to see if there is a better price available on a different market. ISOs can be used to ensure that the trader gets the best possible price across all markets.

Finally, the NMS is not always accurate. There may be times when the best price displayed on the NMS is not actually the best price available. ISOs can be used to ensure that the trader gets the best possible price, even if the NMS is not accurate.

So, while the NMS does display the best burden offer from all the exchanges, there are still a few reasons why ISOs are required. ISOs can be used to sweep through the entire book, to ensure that the trader gets the best possible price across all markets, and to protect the trader from inaccurate information on the NMS.

Does this make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions.

profile picture
that's very important bit of information you provided in both in terms of trading as well as in terms of exam preparation
I would kindly request you to please summarize this
this explanation why
ISO is required although animus is already there in a table
and for each point I I can see that you have multiple points per second and other appointments you can put it them in a table
and
like a
difference between the two you can put it like that with different columns one column for animus one column for
issue and also one column for and example which will clearly explain
because examples are the thing that that has when you are summarizing the things so the examples should be very clear and if you want to be extensive you can be there you can do that okay thanks

Sure, here is a summary of why ISOs are required, along with a table that compares the NMS and ISOs:

Why ISOs are required

The NMS only displays the best burden offer for the top of the book.
The NMS does not display all the different markets that are participating in the order.
The NMS is not always accurate.
Table comparing the NMS and ISOs

Feature	NMS	ISO
Best price displayed	Top of the book	Entire book
Markets displayed	Some markets	All markets
Accuracy	Not always accurate	Always accurate
Examples

A trader wants to buy 100,000 shares of a security. The best burden offer on the NMS is $10.00 per share. However, the trader knows that there are multiple orders at $10.00 per share, and they want to get the best possible price. The trader can use an ISO to sweep through the entire book and get the best possible price, which may be slightly lower than $10.00 per share.
A trader wants to buy 100,000 shares of a security. The best burden offer on the NMS is $10.00 per share. However, the trader only sees that the best price is on the NYSE. The trader does not know that there is a better price available on the Nasdaq. The trader can use an ISO to ensure that they get the best possible price across all markets, which may be slightly lower than $10.00 per share on the Nasdaq.
I hope this summary is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

thanks it's really very helpful
you used a word best burden offer
in multiple places
do you mean bid offer or Barden offer is something
different thing

You're welcome! I'm glad I could be of assistance.

I apologize for the confusion. I did mean best bid offer, not best burden offer. A bid offer is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a security, and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept for a security. The best bid offer is the highest bid and lowest ask that are currently available in the market.



** Question: can you please explain me more about Crossing network trade

A crossing network trade is a type of trade that occurs between two parties without being routed through an exchange or other public displayed market. This means that the trade is not visible to other market participants, and it can be executed at a price that is different from the current market price.

Crossing networks are often used by large institutional investors who want to buy or sell large blocks of shares without affecting the market price. They can also be used by investors who want to trade anonymously.

There are a number of different crossing networks in operation, including Liquidnet, Pipeline Trading Systems, and ITG POSIT. These networks typically charge a fee for their services, but they can offer investors a number of advantages, such as anonymity, speed, and efficiency.

* Benefits of crossing network trades:

Anonymity: Crossing network trades are executed anonymously, which can be beneficial for investors who want to trade without revealing their identity.
Speed: Crossing network trades can be executed quickly, which can be important for investors who need to trade quickly to take advantage of market opportunities.
Efficiency: Crossing network trades can be more efficient than trades that are routed through an exchange, as they do not have to go through the same clearing and settlement process.
However, there are also some risks associated with crossing network trades:

Price volatility: Crossing network trades can sometimes lead to price volatility, as they can be executed at a price that is different from the current market price.
Liquidity: Crossing networks may not always have the same level of liquidity as exchanges, which can make it difficult to trade large blocks of shares.
Fraud: There is a risk of fraud in crossing network trades, as the trades are not subject to the same level of oversight as trades that are routed through an exchange.
Overall, crossing network trades can be a useful tool for investors who want to trade anonymously, quickly, and efficiently. However, it is important to be aware of the risks associated with these trades before using them.

* Regulations that apply to crossing network trades:

SEC Rule 611: This rule prohibits ATSs from engaging in "locked and crossed trades," which are trades that are executed at the same price and time and that have the effect of disadvantaging other market participants.
SEC Rule 610: This rule requires ATSs to provide fair and non-discriminatory access to their markets. This means that all market participants must be able to access the ATS's markets on the same terms and conditions.
SEC Rule 3a51-1: This rule defines an ATS and sets forth the requirements that an ATS must meet in order to be registered with the SEC.
The SEC's regulation of crossing network trades is designed to protect investors and to ensure that these markets are fair and orderly. By requiring crossing networks to comply with the same rules and regulations as traditional exchanges, the SEC is able to ensure that these markets are subject to the same level of oversight.

* Summary of crossing network trades in a table:

Feature	Description	Example
Type of trade	: A trade that occurs between two parties without being routed through an exchange or other public displayed market.	A buyer and seller agree to trade 100 shares of XYZ stock at $100 per share. The trade is executed on a crossing network, and it is not visible to other market participants.
Regulations	Crossing network trades are considered to be alternative trading systems (ATSs) and are therefore subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).	Crossing networks must comply with the same rules and regulations as traditional exchanges, such as the requirement to provide fair and orderly markets. They are also required to report their trades to the SEC's Automated Complex Compliance Examination System (ACCO).
Advantages	* Anonymity: Crossing network trades are executed anonymously, which can be beneficial for investors who want to trade without revealing their identity.
Speed: Crossing network trades can be executed quickly, which can be important for investors who need to trade quickly to take advantage of market opportunities.
Efficiency: Crossing network trades can be more efficient than trades that are routed through an exchange, as they do not have to go through the same clearing and settlement process. | A large institutional investor wants to buy 1 million shares of XYZ stock without affecting the market price. The investor can use a crossing network to execute the trade anonymously and quickly. | | Disadvantages | * Price volatility: Crossing network trades can sometimes lead to price volatility, as they can be executed at a price that is different from the current market price.
Liquidity: Crossing networks may not always have the same level of liquidity as exchanges, which can make it difficult to trade large blocks of shares.
Fraud: There is a risk of fraud in crossing network trades, as the trades are not subject to the same level of oversight as trades that are routed through an exchange. | A small investor wants to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock, but the crossing network does not have enough liquidity to execute the trade. The investor is forced to buy the shares on an exchange, where they pay a higher price. |

A crossed trade is a trade that is executed between two parties without being routed through an exchange. This means that the trade is not visible to other market participants.

Logged trades are typically executed at the best available price, which is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. Crossed trades, on the other hand, can be executed at any price, as long as the two parties agree on the price.

Logged trades are more transparent than crossed trades, as they are visible to all market participants. This means that investors can see the prices at which trades are being executed, which can help them to make informed trading decisions. Crossed trades, on the other hand, are less transparent, as they are not visible to other market participants. This can make it difficult for investors to know the true value of a security.

In general, logged trades are considered to be more fair and orderly than crossed trades. This is because logged trades are executed at the best available price, which ensures that all market participants have an equal opportunity to participate in the trade. Crossed trades, on the other hand, can be executed at any price, which can give one party an unfair advantage over the other.

However, there are some cases where crossed trades may be necessary. For example, if a large institutional investor wants to buy or sell a large block of shares, they may need to use a crossed trade in order to avoid affecting the market price.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates both logged and crossed trades. The SEC's rules require that logged trades be executed at the best available price and that crossed trades be executed in a fair and orderly manner.


* Locked and/or crossed trades, regulation, penalty, and exceptions.

Locked and/or crossed trades are trades that are executed at the same price and time. This can happen when two parties agree to trade a security at a specific price, or when a market maker is forced to buy or sell a security at the same price as another market maker.

Locked and/or crossed trades can be harmful to the market because they can artificially suppress or inflate the price of a security. For example, if a large institutional investor wants to buy a large block of shares, they may be able to drive down the price of the security by executing a series of locked and/or crossed trades.

** Regulation

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates locked and/or crossed trades. The SEC's rules prohibit market makers from engaging in a pattern or practice of displaying quotations that lock or cross protected quotations. Protected quotations are those that are displayed at the best available price.

The SEC's rules also allow for certain exceptions to the prohibition on locked and/or crossed trades. For example, the rules allow for locked and/or crossed trades that are executed in connection with a block trade or that are executed in accordance with an order received from a customer.

** Penalty

Market makers who violate the SEC's rules on locked and/or crossed trades can be subject to a number of penalties, including fines, suspensions, and even deregistration.

** Exceptions

There are a few exceptions to the SEC's rules on locked and/or crossed trades. These exceptions include:

Trades that are executed in connection with a block trade
Trades that are executed in accordance with an order received from a customer
Trades that are executed in response to a market-wide imbalance
Trades that are executed in accordance with an exchange rule
I hope this explanation is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

** Question: can you give me a detailed example it should be in sequence of trading step by step with some real world number for scenario 1 when two parties agree to trade a security at a specific price scenario two when a market maker is forced to buy or sell a security at the price as another Market maker this is in context of locked and or crossed trades
* Detailed examples of locked and/or crossed trades:

Scenario 1: When two parties agree to trade a security at a specific price

Let's say that two investors, Alice and Bob, agree to trade 100 shares of XYZ stock at $100 per share. They can execute this trade as a locked and/or crossed trade by contacting their respective brokers and instructing them to execute the trade at the agreed-upon price.

The sequence of trading would be as follows:

Alice contacts her broker and instructs them to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock at $100 per share.
Bob contacts his broker and instructs them to sell 100 shares of XYZ stock at $100 per share.
The brokers execute the trade at $100 per share.
Scenario 2: When a market maker is forced to buy or sell a security at the same price as another market maker

Let's say that there are two market makers, MM1 and MM2, who are both quoting the same price for 100 shares of XYZ stock. The price is $100 per share.

A customer comes to MM1 and wants to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock. MM1 is willing to sell the shares at $100 per share, but they are not able to buy the shares at that price from another market maker. This is because MM2 is also quoting the price of $100 per share, and MM2 is not willing to sell the shares to MM1 at that price.

In this situation, MM1 is forced to buy the shares from the customer at $100 per share. This is a locked and/or crossed trade because MM1 is buying the shares at the same price that they are quoting.

The sequence of trading would be as follows:

A customer comes to MM1 and wants to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock at $100 per share.
MM1 is willing to sell the shares at $100 per share, but they are not able to buy the shares at that price from another market maker.
MM1 is forced to buy the shares from the customer at $100 per share.

** Question: in the cross street example a customer came to Market maker to buy shares not to sell so how can mm or Market maker is forced to buy the shares from the customer

*** Answer:You're right, the customer in the cross trade example is coming to the market maker to buy shares, not to sell them. However, the market maker is still forced to buy the shares from the customer because they are the only market maker who is quoting a price for the shares.

In this situation, the market maker is said to be "locked up" because they are unable to buy the shares from another market maker at the price that they are quoting. This can happen when there is a lack of liquidity in the market, or when there is a large imbalance between buyers and sellers.

In order to avoid being locked up, market makers will often quote a wider spread between their bid and ask prices. This means that they will be willing to buy the shares at a lower price and sell the shares at a higher price. This wider spread gives the market maker more flexibility in case they are unable to buy the shares from another market maker at their quoted price.


** Question: How can customers sell the shares when he don't have he came to Market maker to buy and at the end Market maker is trying to buy from the same customer who's trying to come to buy from him it's it's confusing

You're right, the customer in the cross trade example doesn't have the shares to sell. In this example, the customer is actually a broker who is acting on behalf of a client who wants to buy the shares.

The broker comes to the market maker to buy the shares, but the market maker is unable to buy the shares from another market maker at the price that they are quoting. This means that the market maker is forced to buy the shares from the broker at the price that the broker is willing to pay.

In this situation, the market maker is essentially buying the shares from themselves, because they are the ones who are quoting the price. This is why the trade is considered to be a locked and/or crossed trade.



* Cross trade example :

Scenario 2: When a market maker is forced to buy or sell a security at the same price as another market maker

Let's say that there are two market makers, MM1 and MM2, who are both quoting the same price for 100 shares of XYZ stock. The price is $100 per share.

A broker comes to MM1 and wants to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock on behalf of their client. MM1 is willing to sell the shares at $100 per share, but they are not able to buy the shares at that price from another market maker. This is because MM2 is also quoting the price of $100 per share, and MM2 is not willing to sell the shares to MM1 at that price.

In this situation, MM1 is forced to buy the shares from the broker at $100 per share. This is a locked and/or crossed trade because MM1 is buying the shares at the same price that they are quoting.

Here are the steps of the trade in more detail:

The broker comes to MM1 and wants to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock on behalf of their client.
MM1 is willing to sell the shares at $100 per share, but they are not able to buy the shares at that price from another market maker.
MM1 is forced to buy the shares from the broker at $100 per share.
The broker then delivers the shares to their client.

In the context of short selling, an "open-fail position" occurs when a short seller is unable to deliver the securities they have contracted to sell by the settlement date. This can happen if the short seller cannot locate the securities to borrow or if there is a problem with the delivery process.

* what is Halt cross?
1
A Halt Cross is an auction process designed to provide an orderly, single-priced opening of securities subject to an intraday halt, including securities that are the subject of an IPO. The Halt Cross is used by Nasdaq to resume trading in securities that have been halted due to significant news events or other factors that have caused the price of the security to become volatile.

The Halt Cross is a two-step process. In the first step, Nasdaq disseminates indicative clearing price and imbalance information to market participants. This information allows market participants to see the current supply and demand for the security and to make informed decisions about whether to participate in the Halt Cross.

In the second step, the Halt Cross is executed. The price at which the Halt Cross is executed is determined by the volume-weighted average price of the bids and offers that were submitted during the indicative clearing price phase.

The Halt Cross is designed to provide a fair and orderly opening for securities that have been halted. It also helps to ensure that all market participants have an opportunity to participate in the opening of the security.

Here are some of the benefits of the Halt Cross:

It provides a fair and orderly opening for securities that have been halted.
It helps to ensure that all market participants have an opportunity to participate in the opening of the security.
It minimizes the potential for price volatility.
Here are some of the limitations of the Halt Cross:

It can be slow to execute, as it requires market participants to submit bids and offers.
It may not always reflect the true value of the security, as it is based on the volume-weighted average price of the bids and offers that were submitted.
Overall, the Halt Cross is a valuable tool that can help to provide a fair and orderly opening for securities that have been halted. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations before using it.
