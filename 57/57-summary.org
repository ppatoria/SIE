| Order routing      | Order is routed straight through to the central interbank market and is filled at the best market rate with no dealer intervention. | Order is routed directly to a counterparty that might be the interbank market, another STP broker, market maker, or even an ECN broker. |
| Speed of execution | An ECN broker executes trades over the ECN for potential investors, which results in the lowest execution time.                     | The speed of execution depends on the exact route it takes on specific orders.                                                          |
| Fee structure      | Always charges a small commission for trades and always has variable spreads.                                                       | Can charge commissions and also earn from the spreads. STP can offer variable and fixed spreads.                                        |
