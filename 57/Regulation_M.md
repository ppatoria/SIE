#### 6.3 Regulation M

```
A fundamental goal of federal securities law is the prevention of manipulation,
which undermines fairness and independence in the markets. Regulation M was
enacted to prevent manipulative conduct by persons with an interest in the out-
come of an offering, including underwriters, issuers, and selling security holders.
Its overall objective is to prohibit activities that could artificially influence the
market for a new issue.
Regulation M includes a definitional introduction, Rule 100, and five conduct
rules, Rules 101–105. The key takeaway from Rule 100 is that Regulation M applies
to both the security being sold, the subject security, and the security into which
the subject security can be converted, the reference security. Together, the sub-
ject security and the reference security are defined as the covered securities.
```
```
Example
If an issuer is selling convertible bonds, both the convertible bonds and the
issuer’s common stock are covered by the provisions of Regulation M.
```
```
The five subsequent conduct rules are:
◆ Rule 101 : Activities by underwriters or other persons who are
participating in a distribution
◆ Rule 102 : Activities by the issuer or selling shareholders
◆ Rule 103 : Nasdaq passive market-making
◆ Rule 104 : Stabilization
◆ Rule 105 : Short-selling in connection with a public offering
It is of greater importance to know the content of the rules rather than the actual
rule numbers.
```

New-Issue Market
```
```
Knopman Note: Regulation M prevents manipulation of a securities
offering, and prohibits sales and trading activities that could artificially
influence the market for a new issue.
```
##### 6.3.1 Rule 101—Activities by a Distribution Participant

```
In general terms, Rule 101 prohibits a distribution participant from attempting
to bid for or purchase, or attempting to induce any other person to bid for or
purchase, a covered security during the applicable restricted period.
Distribution participants include underwriters, prospective underwriters, bro-
ker-dealers, and other persons who have agreed to participate or who are par-
ticipating in a distribution.
```
The period when the restrictions apply is defined by a two-pronged test based
on the **average daily trading volume (ADTV)** of the securities and the **public
float** value of an issuer’s outstanding common stock. There are three categories
of securities and applicable restricted periods:

```

The market maker must
also submit trading

```
Chapter 6
```
New-Issue Market

```
Knopman Note: Make sure to review the restricted periods under
Regulation M.
```
```
Knopman Note: If securities are being distributed in connection with a
merger, an acquisition, or an exchange offer, the restricted period begins
on the first day proxies or offering materials are sent to security holders
and ends upon the completion of the distribution.
```
```
Rule 101 permits certain activities by distribution participants during the
restricted period, including:
◆ The publication of research or recommendations, provided the report is
not to initiate coverage
◆ Odd-lot transactions
◆ Exercises of options, warrants, rights, or conversions into the security
◆ Unsolicited transactions, where the customer initiates the order
◆ Basket transactions that include a basket of 20 or more securities in
which the covered security is not more than 5% of the basket value
◆ Certain de minimis transactions (defined as less than 2% of the ADTV of
the security)
◆ Rule 144A transactions with qualified institutional buyers and non-US
buyers
```
```
Knopman Note: During the Regulation M restricted period, distribution
participants (i.e., underwriters) can also choose to be passive market
makers (discussed below) or can seek an excused withdrawal.
```
```
Certain securities are not subject to the provisions of Rule 101:
◆ Investment-grade nonconvertible securities and asset-backed securities,
and
◆ Face-amount certificates or securities issued by an open-end
management investment company or unit trust
```
##### 6.3.2 Rule 102—Activities by Issuers and Selling Security Holders

```
Rule 102 is similar to Rule 101, but it addresses activities of issuers, selling security
holders, and their affiliated purchasers during a distribution of securities. An
affiliated purchaser is defined as anyone acting in concert with issuers and
selling security holders.
These persons must also refrain from bidding for, purchasing for, or attempting to
induce any person to bid for or purchase a covered security during the applicable
restricted period, unless an exception permits the activity.
```

```
Chapter 6
New-Issue Market
```
```
Knopman Note: Reg M Rule 102 limits how the issuer, selling security
holders, and insiders can sell their stock during a follow-on offering.
```
```
6.3.2.1 Notification Requirements Under Rules 101 and 102
```
The syndicate manager is responsible for providing written notice to FINRA of
information regarding compliance with Regulation M Rules 101 and 102. The table
below summarizes the events that require FINRA notification.

```
Notification Event Date Required
Length of restricted period and date it will begin No later than the business day before the first day of the restricted period
```
```
Pricing of the distribution, the security and symbol,
number of shares offered, and offering price
```
```
No later than the close of business on the
first business day following the pricing of the
distribution
Cancellation or postponement of any distribution
for which prior notification had been made Immediately
```
The lead manager, or a third-party agent, electronically files these notifications
with FINRA on behalf of all syndicate members. The lead manager’s negligence
in filing, however, does not reduce the responsibility of other members for failure
to provide notification. Syndicate participants should request written copies of
all required notification forms from the lead manager.

##### 6.3.3 Rule 103—Nasdaq Passive Market-Making

```
Rule 103 allows broker-dealers to engage in passive market-making in Nasdaq
securities during the restricted period.
```
```
Knopman Note: Passive market making must be done with a primary
MPID only, never a supplemental MPID.
```
```
6.3.3.1 Highest Bid
```
A passive market maker may not bid on the covered securities at a price exceed-
ing the highest independent bid. The **highest independent bid** is the highest
bid by a market maker that is not also an underwriter.

```
Example
The highest independent bid in a security is $24 per share. A passive market
maker can bid $24 per share (or less) but cannot bid higher than $24 per share.
```
```
6.3.3.2 Net Purchase Limitation
On each day of the restricted period, a passive market maker’s net purchases can-
not exceed the greater of 30% of the market maker’s daily trading volume (DTV)
```

```
Chapter 6
```
New-Issue Market

```
limit or 200 shares. The DTV limit is based off the market maker’s average daily
trading volume in the security during the two full calendar months immediately
preceding the filing of the registration statement.
```
```
Example
A market maker’s average daily trading volume in a covered security is 100,000
shares. Therefore, the market maker’s net purchases as a passive market
maker may not exceed 30,000 shares. If the market maker has bought 80,000
shares on a given day and sold 65,000 shares, it is a net purchaser of 15,000
shares. Therefore, it can continue its passive market-making activities.
```
```
Note that the market maker may buy more than 30,000 shares on any day but
the net total, or purchases minus sales, may not exceed 30,000.
```
```
A market maker’s displayed bid size cannot exceed the remaining shares avail-
able until the firm reaches its net purchase limitation. However, if the remaining
shares under the limit equal less than one round lot, the market maker can still
bid for one round lot.
```
```
Example
A passive market maker is bidding 32.75 at a time when the highest indepen-
dent bid is also 32.75. The market maker has a daily net purchase limitation
of 400 shares, of which it has been a net purchaser of 100 shares. The market
maker’s bid size cannot exceed three round lots (300 shares).
```
```
Example
A passive market maker is bidding 32.75 at a time when the highest indepen-
dent bid is also 32.75. The market maker has a daily net purchase limitation
of 400 shares, of which it has been a net purchaser of 350 shares. The market
maker can still show a bid size for one round lot (100 shares), even though its
purchasing capacity is now only 50 shares.
```
```
6.3.3.3 Adjusting Bids
If the highest independent bid increases, the passive market maker can immedi-
ately increase its bid to equal the new bid.
The rules are slightly more complex when the highest independent bid falls. If all
independent bids are reduced to a price below the passive market maker’s bid,
the market maker must promptly, but not immediately, adjust its bid to a price
not higher than the highest independent bid.
Specifically, the market maker may purchase up to two times the minimum quote
size in the security, or the remaining amount of its net purchase limitation, before
lowering its bid. The minimum quote size is typically 100 shares.
```

```
Chapter 6
New-Issue Market
```
```
Example
At 10:00 am, a passive market maker is currently bidding 43.75 for 300 shares,
a bid equal to the highest independent bid. Furthermore, the firm’s net
purchase limitation is 800 shares, and it has been a net purchaser of 400
shares so far today.
```
```
At 10:02 am, the best independent bid drops to 43.70. The passive market
maker can purchase two times the minimum quote size, or 200 shares, at its
current bid of 43.75 and then must drop its bid to 43.70.
```
```
Example
At 10:00 am, a passive market maker is currently bidding 43.75 for 300 shares,
a bid equal to the highest independent bid. Furthermore, the firm’s net
purchase limitation is 800 shares, and it has been a net purchaser of 750
shares so far today. Therefore, it can purchase 50 more shares before reaching
its net purchase limit for the day.
```
```
At 10:02 am, the best independent bid drops to 43.70. The passive market
maker can purchase up to 50 shares at 43.75 and then must withdraw from
the market for the rest of the day. In this case, purchasing two times the min-
imum quote size is not permitted because, once the passive market maker
purchases 50 shares, it will hit its limit for the day.
```
In all cases, a passive market maker can purchase shares as part of a single cus-
tomer order that exceeds the net purchase limitation, provided that it withdraws
from the market for the rest of the day.

```
Knopman Note: Passive market-making means a market maker can bid no
higher than the best independent bid in a security. It can increase its bid
when the best independent bid increases and must reduce its bid (after
purchasing up to two times the minimum quotation size, if desired) when
the best independent bid falls. Once its net purchases exceed 30% of the
ADTV, it must withdraw from the market for the rest of the day.
Candidates should be familiar with the pricing rules regarding passive
market-making, along with the limit to its daily trading activity and when
a passive market maker must withdraw its bid.
```
##### 6.3.4 Rule 104—Stabilization and Penalty Bids

**Stabilization** is one of the functions that a syndicate performs during an offering,
and it must be managed carefully to stay within regulatory guidelines.

Stabilization allows an underwriter to bid on a new issue in the secondary mar-
ket to prevent a decline in price. The firm that stabilizes on behalf of the syndicate
is referred to as the **stabilization agent**. This is usually the syndicate manager. A
stabilization bid can last indefinitely—no rule limits its duration.


```
Chapter 6
```
New-Issue Market

```
Stabilizing activities must always be anticipated, planned, and announced in
advance. They cannot be done as a knee-jerk response to a falling IPO price.
When an underwriter stabilizes a new issue, restrictions apply to the price of
the stabilizing bid. The first rule is that a stabilization bid must always be at or
below the public offering price. For example, if the public offering price is $30, a
stabilizing bid may never be higher than $30.
The second pricing requirement provides that the stabilizing bid be entered at a
specific price depending on the current bid, ask, and last independent transaction:
◆ If the current best asked price is greater than or equal to the last
independent transaction price (i.e., last sale), stabilization can occur at
that last independent transaction price.
◆ If the current best asked price is less than the last sale, stabilization can
occur at the highest current independent bid.
This chart will help explain how and where stabilization can occur:
```
```
Scenario 1 Scenario 2
Current best ask ≥ last independent transaction
price (i.e., last sale)
```
```
Current best ask < last independent transaction
price (i.e., last sale)
Stabilize at last independent transaction price Stabilize at highest current independent bid
Examples
POP: $30
Last independent transaction: $27.50
Current bid–ask: $27.10–$27.90
Stabilize at $27 .50 (last independent
transaction) because the current ask is greater
than or equal to the last independent transaction.
```
```
POP: $30
Last independent transaction: $27.50
Current bid–ask: $27.10–$27.30
Stabilize at $27 .10 (highest current independent
bid) because the current ask is less than the last
independent transaction.
```
```
The principal market is defined under Rule 100 as the market with the largest
reported trading volume for that security during the prior 12 calendar months.
If such trading data is not available, the stabilization bid will be entered in the
market where the issuer elected to have its primary listing (e.g., NYSE or Nasdaq).
Stabilization bids are heavily regulated and must comply with all of the following
requirements:
◆ The stabilization agent must give priority to an independent bid at the
same price, regardless of its size.
◆ Only one stabilization bid can be entered at any one time.
◆ The stabilization agent cannot bid on the stock in addition to its
stabilization bid.
◆ The stabilization agent must give prior regulatory notice to the SEC.
```

```
Chapter 6
New-Issue Market
```
```
Knopman Note: Here are some key items regarding stabilization bids:
```
```
Q: Which MPID must a market maker use for stabilization?
A: A firm must use its primary MPID, not a supplemental MPID for
stabilization.
```
```
Q: How many underwriters can simultaneously stabilize an IPO?
A: There may only be one stabilization bid at any time. The stabilization
agent is typically the managing underwriter.
```
```
Q: How long can a stabilization bid remain available in the market?
A: No regulatory rule covers the time limit of a stabilization bid, so in
theory, it can be outstanding indefinitely.
```
```
Q: Can a market maker initiate stabilization in a security when no other
market makers are actively quoting the stock?
A: It is permissible to initiate stabilization in a security where no
independent market makers are quoting the stock. If no bona fide
market for the covered security exists (i.e., no independent bids), the
initiating stabilization price must be equal to or less than the offering
price.
```
```
Q: Can stabilization be initiated when the market is closed?
A: Yes. If an underwriter initiates stabilization when the market is closed,
the maximum stabilization bid is the prior closing price. For example,
an IPO opens at $40 per share and closes that day at $39.45. The
maximum price a stabilizing bid may be entered for the next day is
$39.45.
```
```
6.3.4.1 Penalty Bids
```
A penalty bid is imposed (usually by the lead manager) against a syndicate mem-
ber when newly issued securities are flipped by the investor and sold into the
stabilizing bid. Any **selling concessions** granted to the member are forfeited
and the selling broker-dealer involved in the trade is not paid. Penalty bids are
designed to discourage the allocation of shares to “fast-buck speculators.” They
also reduce selling pressure during the first days of after-market trading.
Rule 104 requires any person making a penalty bid to provide prior notice to
regulators of the principal market in which the penalty bid is imposed.
Penalty bids must be anticipated and announced to syndicate members prior to
the effective date. They cannot be imposed retroactively.


```
Chapter 6
```
New-Issue Market

```
6.3.4.2 Recordkeeping Requirements for Stabilization and Penalty Bids
SEC Rule 17a-2 defines the recordkeeping requirements for syndicate group mem-
bers who engage in stabilizing activities or penalty bids. The following records
must be maintained for at least three years in total, and for at least the first two
years in an easily accessible place:
◆ The name and class of security stabilized or subject to a penalty bid
◆ The price, date, and time at which each stabilizing purchase was entered,
and whether any penalties were assessed
◆ The names and addresses of members of the syndicate or selling group
◆ The commitments of each member in the group
◆ The dates when any penalty bid was in effect
It is the responsibility of each member of the syndicate or selling group entering
a stabilizing bid to promptly furnish the date and time when the first stabilizing
purchase was made and the date and time at which stabilization was terminated.
The rule requires that all members of the syndicate be informed of the beginning
and end of any stabilization efforts.
```
```
6.3.4.3 Syndicate Covering Transactions
One drawback of stabilization under Rule 104 is that the underwriter must notify
the SEC of such activity. The SEC, in turn, disseminates the information to the
public. This creates a negative perception of the deal and can intensify selling
pressure in the secondary market. As a result, many underwriters elect to engage
in syndicate covering transactions instead of pure stabilization.
In a typical new issue, the underwriter will sell more shares than have been reg-
istered. In fact, IPOs are almost always oversold by 15%, the maximum amount
of the green shoe clause. The green shoe clause allows the underwriter, at its
discretion, to increase the number of issued shares by 15%. Alternatively, the
underwriter can cover the oversold shares by engaging in a syndicate covering
transaction.
```
```
Knopman Note: The green shoe clause in an underwriting agreement
permits the underwriter to increase the size of the deal by up to 15% to
meet investor demand.
```
```
A syndicate covering transaction is a bid made by the underwriting syndicate
to reduce the short position created in connection with the oversold offering.
The underwriter purchases shares in the secondary market to make delivery on
the undelivered portion of the new issue. Underwriters generally prefer a syndi-
cate covering transaction over a Rule 104 stabilization bid because there are no
price restrictions and there is no disclosure requirement to the public. As a result,
these transactions allow the underwriter to support the price without creating
the perception that the deal is not being well received.
```

```
Chapter 6
New-Issue Market
```
```
6.3.4.4 OTC Equities—Penalty Bids and Syndicate Covering Transactions
```
FINRA Rule 5190(e) requires members who impose penalty bids or engage in
syndicate covering transactions involving OTC equities to provide two types of
written notice to FINRA:

```
◆ Prior notice —An underwriter must give written notice of its intent to
impose a penalty bid or engage in a syndicate covering transaction. The
notice must include the security’s ID, the security’s symbol, and the
date(s) such activity will occur.
◆ Confirmation notice —An underwriter must give written confirmation
of any imposed penalty bid or syndicate covering transaction within one
business day of the completion of this activity. The notice must include
the security’s ID, the security’s symbol, total shares involved, and the
date(s) of activity.
```
Neither notice is made public. They are for FINRA’s use in monitoring compliance
with Regulation M.

```
Knopman Note:
```
```
Q: Are underwriters required to notify FINRA both before and after
engaging in a penalty bid or syndicate covering transaction?
A: Yes. A member imposing a penalty bid or syndicate covering
transaction in an OTC equity security (e.g., an IPO) must provide
FINRA with:
```
- Advance written notice of the penalty bid or syndicate covering
    transaction, and
- Written confirmation of the penalty bid or syndicate covering
    transaction, within one business day of completion of such activity,
    including identification of the security, the total number of shares,
    and the dates of such activity

##### 6.3.5 Rule 105—Short-Selling in Connection with a Public Offering

Rule 105 prohibits _anyone_ from purchasing securities in a public offering if that
person sold the same securities short within the five-business-day period pre-
ceding the pricing of the offered securities. The purpose of the rule is to prevent
an investor from shorting a significant amount of stock just prior to the pricing
of a follow-on offering and subsequently closing that short position by repur-
chasing the stock at the now depressed offer price. To do so is manipulative and
a violation.

```
Knopman Note: Rule 105 applies to firm commitment equity follow-on
offerings. It does not apply to best efforts equity offerings or initial public
offerings (IPOs).
```

```
Chapter 6
```
New-Issue Market

```
Regulation M Rule 105 restrictions on short sales and purchases during the
restricted period apply to all investors. The rule does not apply to short sales
executed more than five business days before the pricing of the new issue.
```
```
Example
BHS Hedge Fund sells short 12,000 shares of ABC common stock on Friday,
March 13. On Monday, March 16, ABC Corp prices a follow-on offering. BHS
is prohibited from investing in the follow-on offering because it established
a short position within five business days prior to pricing of the new issue.
```
```
Example
BHS Hedge Fund sells short 12,000 shares of ABC common stock on Friday,
March 13. On Monday, March 23, ABC Corp prices a follow-on offering. BHS is
permitted to invest in the new issue since the short position was established
more than five business days prior to pricing.
```
```
The five-day period is shorter if the registration statement for the new issue is
filed less than five business days prior to pricing. In that case, Rule 105 applies
on the date the registration statement is filed and ends when the deal is priced.
```
```
Knopman Note: An exception to Regulation M’s Rule 105 allows bona
fide investors who meet certain conditions to short sell within the five
day restricted period and still invest in the newly offered shares as long as
the investor closes their short position in the market prior. For example,
if an investor sells short 1,000 shares of XYZ on Monday, but then covers
their short position on Tuesday, they would be permitted to still invest
in the follow-on offering occurring on Wednesday. To use the exception,
the latest a short sale trade can occur is 30 minutes prior to the close on
the business day prior to the pricing.
```
##### 6.3.6 FINRA Rules Regarding Regulation M

```
FINRA Rule 6435 requires distribution participants (i.e., underwriters) to with-
draw from market-making activities in OTC equity securities during the applica-
ble restricted period (one or five days) under Rule 101 of Regulation M.
Furthermore, the rule prohibits underwriters from entering stabilizing bids for
OTC equity securities under Rule 104.
```
