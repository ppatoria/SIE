note left
  Broker-Dealer may have agreements with institutional investors to borrow securities for short selling.
  If securities are not available in inventory, the broker-dealer can locate securities from other sources such as institutional investors.
  Trade settlement occurs on T + 3 business days after the trade date.
  If settlement fails, the broker-dealer may provide an additional two business days before regulatory penalties apply.
