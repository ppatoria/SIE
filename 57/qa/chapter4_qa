6) What defense can a broker-dealer, which has the appropriate
   procedures in place, offer against the allegation that it has engaged in
   self-trading?
    A) The self-trading was not profitable for the firm.
    B) The self-trading did not inflict direct harm on any customer.
    C) The self-trading was unintentional.
    D) The self-trading involved a proprietary account, not a customer
   account.
   Answer Explanation:
   Self-trades occur when both sides of a trade originate with the same firm.
   Broker-dealers must have procedures in place to review and prevent a
   pattern of self-trades. Assuming supervisory procedures are in place, self-
   trades are not violations when they are unintentional i.e., there was no
   intent to create an illusion of trading activity or price. Note that this concept
   is not explicitly covered in the 2nd Edition textbook, but is covered in the
   Class Summary and as long as you review the rationale you will be
   prepared for this item.

12) A market maker is currently quoting $35.60 - $35.80 20 x 34 and is
    holding, but not displaying the following customer limit: Buy 50
    shares at $35.60 and Buy 120 shares at $35.60. Which of the

     C) Buy 80 shares at $35.60
     D) Buy 2000 shares at $35.60
    Answer Explanation:
    Firm must aggregate multiple, same-priced customer limit orders to
    determine whether the de minimis standard has been exceeded. Because
    the firm is holding, but not displaying orders to purchase 170 shares, once
    a new order is received for more than 30 shares, the aggregate customer
    shares would exceed the 10% de minimis exception for the 20 displayed
    round lots and the quote must be updated.

29) A customer with total assets of $75 million has placed an order to
    purchase 20,000 shares of XYZ on a "net" basis. Consent for this
    transaction
     A) Must be established in writing prior to the execution of the trade
     B) Must be provided in a negative consent letter
     C) Must be provided in an affirmative consent letter received promptly
    following the execution of the trade
     D) May be provided in a negative consent letter
    Answer Explanation:
    When effecting "net" trades with institutional customers, a firm must
    obtain the customer's consent prior to executing the transaction. The
    allowable methods to obtain consent differ between retail and institutional
    clients. Any entity with assets of at least $50 million (including an
    individual investor) is considered an institutional customer according to
    FINRA rules. The consent from institutional clients for net trades may be
    provided in a variety of ways, including a negative consent letter. The firm
    may also accept oral consent from the customer, as well as written
    consent.

    liquidate a block of 45,000 shares of stock, worth over $2 million.
    The firm decides to liquidate the block in parts over the course of
    the trading day. In regard to this block, when does firm's

    already been executed, the entire order must be filled and publicly
    reported to avoid a violation.

    at what prices?
     A) Flat

    firms act as an agent or broker they must charge fair and reasonable
    commissions. The general guideline is that a mark-up/mark-down or
    commission in excess of 5% is not reasonable.

37) A customer has entered a limit order to buy 200 shares of XYZ stock
    at $44.58, AON. If the issuer declares a cash dividend of 24.5 cents
    per share what will this order become on the ex-dividend date?
     A) The order will be cancelled
     B) Buy 200 @ $44.34, AON
     C) Buy 200 @ 44.33, AON
     D) Buy 200 @ $44.58
    Answer Explanation:
    For buy limit and sell stop orders, cash dividends for fractional cents are
    rounded up (to the next whole cent) on ex-dividend dates. In this case,
    the dividend is rounded up to 25 cents and the limit price is reduced from
    $44.58 to $44.33. Note that special instructions such as AON (all-or-none)
    remain unchanged.

     A) Clear disclosure and post-trade approval
     B) Clear disclosure only, with no required approval

    differs from an agency transaction, in which prior client consent may be
    approved on a standing (blanket) basis.

    A pegged order is a special type of limit order that automatically adjusts
    as the market moves. Any order with a limit price is not necessarily a
    pegged order.

44) A customer owns 600 shares of stock originally purchased at $63
    per share. The last trade in the stock was $85. What order would the
    customer place to protect their current appreciation in the stock?
     A) Sell limit order at or above $85
     B) Sell stop order at or below $85
     C) Sell limit order at or below $85
     D) Sell stop order at or above $85
    Answer Explanation:
    A sell stop order at or below the current market price would be used to
    protect the investor's position. With the sell stop, if the price hits $85 or
    below the order would be triggered and then become a market order to
    immediately sell the position in order to lock in the investor's profit.

    shareholders do not vote on payment of dividends. Dividends are paid to
    stockholders who own stock as of the date of record. The ex-date
    represents the first day on which an individual purchases stock without
    being entitled to the dividend.

    appearance of trading activity or interest.

48) A broker-dealer has received an order from a retail customer for a
    non-U.S. traded security. Broker-dealer policies regarding these
    securities
     A) Need not be maintained as there can never be any assurance that
    the customer will receive a favorable execution in a foreign market.
     B) Must stipulate that the firm will use reasonable diligence to obtain
    the most favorable terms available for the customer.
     C) Must direct this order to be transmitted to the international sales
    desk of the firm.
     D) Need not include provisions for the most favorable execution
    possible in light of differences between U.S. markets and foreign markets
    Answer Explanation:
    Although a security may not trade in the U.S., broker-dealers still have
    obligations to seek best execution for customer orders involving any
    foreign security. This premise must be stipulated in specific written
    policies and procedures maintained by the firm.

49) A company "reverse splits" its stock on a 1-for-10 basis. If an
    investor holds 800 shares before the event, what will be the impact
    of the split, if any, on the total value of the investors' shares?
     A) Total value will decline by 10%
     B) Total value will not change
     C) Total value will decline by 90%
     D) Total value will increase by 10 times
    Answer Explanation:
    Stock splits and reverse splits don't change the total value of investors'
    holdings. For example, if the investor owned 800 shares at $1 per share
    before the 1-for-10 reverse split, he/she will own 80 shares at about $10
    per share after the event.

    Answer Explanation:
    A market maker may trade ahead of a customer limit order under certain
    specific conditions. One of these is where the firm has implemented
    effective information barriers to prevent one trading desk from obtaining
    knowledge of customer orders on a different trading desk.

     A) Risk that securities may lose value
     B) Risk of Changing Prices
     C) Risk of no liquidity
     D) Risk of Unlinked Markets
    Answer Explanation:
    Retail investors generally should be discouraged from extended-hours
    trading due to the higher risk and greater potential for unfavorable trade
    execution. The disclosure must cover six specific types of risk, but that
    securities may lose value is not a part of the extended hours risk
    document; though that may be disclosed in other brokerage documents.

76) A customer has entered two open limit orders: buy 100 shares of
    XYZ Corp. at $35.15 and sell 100 shares of XYZ Corp. at $37.14. If
    XYZ then declares a cash dividend of $0.115 per share, what will
    each order be adjusted to on the morning of the ex-dividend date?
     A) Buy 100 XYZ at $35.03; sell 100 XYZ at $37.02
     B) Buy 100 XYZ at $35.15; sell 100 XYZ at $37.03
     C) Buy 100 XYZ at $35.26; sell 100 XYZ at $37.25
     D) Buy 100 XYZ at $35.03; sell 100 XYZ at $37.14
    Answer Explanation:
    Only orders entered below the market price are adjusted for cash
    dividends. These include buy limit, sell stop and sell stop limit. The sell
    limit order is not adjusted. Fractional-cent dividends are rounded up for
    adjustment purposes i.e., from 11.5 cents to 12.0 cents. Therefore, the
    buy limit order is adjusted downwards by $0.12 per share on the ex-
    dividend date, and the sell limit order is not adjusted.

87) KG Securities is an OTC market maker that displays priced
    quotations in OTC equity securities in an inter-dealer quotation
    system on a regular basis for its proprietary account and its
    customer accounts. Which of the follow criteria is not relevant to
    determine if KG Securities must update the size of its published its
    quotes?
     A) The size of the customer's limit price as compared to the size of KG
    Security's quote
     B) The customer's limit price as compared to the best bid and offer of
    the quote on the specific inter-dealer quotation system where KG Security
    is quoting
     C) The customer's limit price as compared to KG Securities' quote
     D) The customer's limit price as compared to the NBBO of the quote
    across all inter-dealer quotation systems
    Answer Explanation:
    When determining whether to update its quotes an OTC market maker
    does not consider the National Best Bid Offer (NBBO), but rather looks to
    the best bid and office on the specific quotation system where its quotes
    are posted. FINRA Rule 6460 requires OTC Market Makers that display
    priced quotations in an inter-dealer quotation system to immediately
    display the full size of any customer limit order held by the OTC Market
    Maker that (1) is priced equal to the bid or offer of the Market Maker; and
    (2) is priced equal to the BBO of the inter-dealer quotation system in
    which the OTC Market Maker is quoting; and (3) represents more than a
    de minimis change (10% of the size) in relation to the size associated with
    the OTC Market Maker's bid or offer.

     C) Every customer order KG Securities receives must be displayed
     D) Each customer order KG Securities receives that is at a price that is

    quotations in any inter-dealer quotation system to immediately update and
    publish any customer bid or offer that is at a price that improves the

99) A broker-dealer enters an order to buy shares of stock for its own
    account at about the same time a customer places a block order to
    sell the same stock. This is a front-running violation if

100) A company's stock splits 3-for-2. If it was trading at a price of $30
      before the split, approximately what will its share price be after the
      split?
       A) $15
       B) $20

      Stock splits don't alter the total value that shareholders have, only the
      price per share. A 3-for-2 split creates three shares for every two held
      before. Three shares after the split must be worth about the same as two
      shares before the split (two shares at $30 each = $60). Each of the three
      shares must be worth $20 after the split.

     must update its bid (within 30 seconds) to 18.48, for a size of 500 shares
     (the size of the customer bid).

124) An OTC market maker is currently quoting $43.20-$43.75 22 x 17.
     Which of the following customer limit orders would require the
     market maker to update its displayed quote?
      A) Sell 100 shares at $43.75
      B) Sell 200 shares at $43.75
      C) Buy 200 shares at $43.20
      D) Buy 100 shares at $43.20
     Answer Explanation:
     The limit order display rule requires that market makers update their
     displayed quotes if a customer places a limit order that is (1) equal to the
     market maker's quote, and (2) equal to the BBO on the inter-dealer
     quotation system, and (3) represents more than a de minimis change
     (>10% than the market maker's quote) in relation to the size associated
     with the OTC Market Maker's bid or offer. Here, only the customer's sell
     order for 200 represents more than a de minimis change requiring the
     firm to update its displayed quote.

     to read it in hard-copy.

135) Broker-Dealer ABC receives an order from a customer to purchase
     200 shares of XYZ stock. In order to fill the customer's order,
     Broker-Dealer ABC buys 200 shares of XYZ stock at $60 per share
     and then sells the 200 shares to the customer at $60 per share, plus
     a commission. This is a

      B) stopped stock transaction.
      C) qualified contingent trade.
      D) net transaction.
     Answer Explanation:
     This is a riskless principal trade as both legs of the trade are executed at
     the same price. The difference between a riskless principal trade and a
     net trade is that both legs of a riskless principal trade are done at the
     same price, whereas the two legs of a net trade are at different prices.

      B) qualifies as a facilitated order.
      C) requires prior notification to the customer.
      D) requires prior approval from the customer.
     Answer Explanation:

137) ABC Co. is announcing its quarterly earnings at 5 pm, after the
     market closes. A customer believes the earnings will be
     blockbuster and the stock price will move higher very quickly. She
     wants to quickly verify that the earnings are strong and then enter a
     market order to buy 800 shares of the stock, within a minute or less
     later, during extended market hours. What is the investor's main
     risk?
      A) Extra trading costs
      B) Trade cancellation risk
      C) Extraordinary volatility
      D) Timing lag
     Answer Explanation:
     Greater price volatility usually is a risk factor in extended hours trading.
     This risk is amplified when there are news announcements, such as
     earnings. Stocks often soar or sink quickly after earnings are released,
     only to reverse the move later or during normal market hours the next
     day, when there may be more context to the news (for example,
     research analysts' views) and greater trading volume.

139) OTC market makers generally are required to immediately publish
     customer limit orders that would improve the market maker's bid or
     offer. Which of the following order sizes fall under an exception?
      A) Buy 150 shares
      B) Buy 5,000 shares
      C) Buy 1,200 shares
      D) Buy 87 shares
     Answer Explanation:
     Two of the exceptions are based on order size: odd-lot and block size.

     generally is 10,000 shares or more.

140) Gerald places an order to buy 1000 shares of an OTC equity from
     his market maker firm. The firm's current quote is $4.24 - $4.30 3 x 5,
     and executes Gerald's order upon receipt. Does the firm need to
     update its quote?
      A) No, because the order is for a penny stock.
      B) Yes, because the order was priced equal or better than the firm's
     quote.
      C) Yes, because the order is greater than the de minimums
     exception.
      D) No, because the order was executed upon receipt.
     Answer Explanation:
     The general rule requires firms display customer limit orders, but there
     are a variety of exceptions when an order does not need to be
     displayed. The rule excepts any customer limit order that is: executed
     upon receipt of the order; placed by a customer who expressly requests
     that the order not be displayed; an odd-lot order; a block size order;
     delivered immediately upon receipt to a national securities exchange or
     an ECN that widely disseminates such order; delivered immediately
     upon receipt to another OTC Market Maker that displays the order; or an
     all-or-none order. Because Gerald's order was executed upon receipt,
     the firm does not need to update its quote.

     Marketable limit orders can be filled immediately, given the current
     market price. This sell order is three cents above the best bid price
     (63.25), so it cannot be filled immediately. It is a resting limit order, not a
     marketable limit order.

152) A customer tells her broker that she wants to buy a large amount of
     a volatile stock. The broker discourages this but the customer does
     it anyway. Later, after losing money, she sues him for making an
     unsuitable recommendation. The key to the broker's defense may
     be that
      A) the trade was not discretionary.
      B) the customer is quite wealthy.
      C) the trade was unsolicited.

     difference is that solicited trades must be suitable, but unsolicited trades
     do not constitute recommendations and thus are not subject to the same
     standard.

166) Broker-dealer C receives a customer limit order to sell 1,000 shares
     of an OTC equity at $59, at a time when C's best offer to sell the
     same stock is at a higher price. Broker Dealer C must immediately
     display the customer limit order, unless it is which type of order?
      A) Fill or kill (FOK)
      B) All or none (AON)
      C) Day Order
      D) Good til cancelled (GTC)
     Answer Explanation:
     An AON limit order is one exception to the requirement to immediately
     display a customer limit order on better terms than the member's
     bid/offer. Since it has the AON qualifier it is not comparable to a straight
     limit order.

167) A customer has entered an order to buy 200 shares of ABC Co.
     stock at $45.25 per share. ABC has recently declared a cash
     dividend of $0.20 per share, payable to holders of record on
     Wednesday, May 4th. How will the order have been adjusted if it is
     still on the books as of the record date?
      A) The order will not be adjusted and instead remain on the books at
     "buy 200 shares at $45.25"
      B) Prior to the open on Monday, it will be adjusted to "buy 200 shares
     at $45.05"
      C) Prior to the open on Tuesday, it will be adjusted to "buy 200
     shares at $45.05"
      D) Prior to the open on Tuesday, it will be adjusted to "buy 200
     shares at $45.45"
     Answer Explanation:
     Buy limit, sell stop and sell stop limit orders are reduced by the amount
     of a cash dividend prior to the open of trading on the ex-dividend date.
     Remember, that the ex-dividend date for regular way trades is always
     one business day prior to the record date. Therefore, this buy limit order
     is adjusted downwards by $0.20 prior to the open of trading on Tuesday.

168) Under FINRA's Standards of Commercial Honor and Principles of
     Trade all of the following may be considered by a firm when
     charging a commission in an agency transaction, except:
      A) market conditions with respect to such security at the time of the
     transaction
      B) the fact that the firm is entitled to a profit
      C) the expense of executing the order
      D) the value of any service rendered by reason of the firm's
     experience
     Answer Explanation:
     Commissions charged in agency transactions must be fair and
     reasonable. In determining fair and reasonable commissions a firm may
     consider market conditions with respect to such security at the time of
     the transaction, the expense of executing the order and the value of any
     service rendered by reason of the firm's experience in and knowledge of
     such security and the market therefor. When executing trades in an
     agency basis, however, the commission does not contemplate the fact
     that the firm is entitled to a profit.

     Answer Explanation:
     The instruction DNR (Do Not Reduce) advises the member firm not to

      C) The right of the firm to make a profit

     used as a pricing factor when trading in an agency capacity.

      D) Paired order

      B) Reduction on a pro rata basis for both cash and securities
      C) Reduction by the value of securities
      D) Reduction by the value of cash or securities, whichever is greater
     Answer Explanation:
     In this case, it is the shareholder's option to take either cash or
     securities. Presumably, the shareholder will elect the option with the
     greater value. So, the open order price is adjusted by the greater
     amount.

      C) For quotes that are priced within 5% of the NBBO
      D) For quotes that are priced within 10% of the NBBO

     The size of a customer limit order is considered de minimis - and
     therefore is not required to be displayed - if it is less than or equal to 10
     percent of the displayed size associated with a market maker's bid or
     offer. It does not look to the NBBO.

      C) Is always considered reasonable

     Answer Explanation:
     A mark-up pattern of 5% or less may be considered unfair or
     unreasonable, depending on the facts and circumstances of the
     transaction. Remember, the 5% is a policy, not a hard and fast rule
     (firms charging under 5% can still be found to be charging unreasonable
     fees).

192) What happens to a buy stop order before the ex-date of a stock
     split?
      A) It must be adjusted in price only, not number of shares
      B) It must be adjusted in both price and number of shares
      C) Nothing

     split had been a reverse split (e.g. 1:4) then all open orders are
     cancelled.

193) Registered Rep G is walking down the hall of his firm and hears
     somebody whisper on the phone "block buy of ABC Co. tomorrow."
     He doesn't know any details about the trade, such as buyer or
     quantity. But he decides to buy a few shares for his own account
     anyway, because there has not been any public word about such a
     block trade. Is he front-running?
      A) No, because the source of the information is not an insider
      B) No, because his trade is not based on solid information
      C) Yes, because the information came from within his own firm
      D) Yes, because partial advance knowledge of a block trade is
     enough
     Answer Explanation:
     Partial knowledge of an imminent block trade can be enough to trigger
     front-running, if it is material and non-public and the trader has
     knowledge that the transaction will be agreed upon imminently. The
     source of the information is irrelevant.

194) A group of traders coordinates orders on both sides of the market,
     so as to give the appearance of larger demand for a stock than
     actually exists. This practice is
      A) allowed, but only if it is documented in writing.
      B) considered to be a violation of fiduciary duty to customers.
      C) considered to be collusion.
      D) allowed, but only if all participants are not market makers.
     Answer Explanation:
     Collusion is a manipulative prohibited practice in which traders
     coordinate prices or bid-ask spreads.

195) Registered Rep W hears material information about an imminent
     block sale transaction to sell shares of ABC Co. If he buys put
     options on the company's stock, is he front-running?
      A) Yes, if they are in-the-money
      B) No, because the securities must be of the same type
      C) No, because options are specifically exempt
      D) Yes, if he does so before the block trade is completed and
     reported
     Answer Explanation:
     The rule against front-running does not require the trade to be in the
     same security as the block. It can be a related financial instrument, or a
     security underlying the security involved in the block. Buying put options
     is akin to selling stock.

196) How often must regular and rigorous reviews of the overall quality
     of order executions occur, for a member who routes customer
     orders to another broker-dealer on an automated, non-discretionary
     basis?
      A) Semi-annually
      B) Quarterly
      C) Monthly
      D) Annually
     Answer Explanation:
     The reviews must be conducted on a security-by-security basis and by

197) For purposes of FINRA's rule against front-running, information
     about a block transaction is made publicly available when
      A) It is announced by the issuer
      B) It is generally well known to the investment community
      C) The entire block transaction has been completed and reported
      D) It is prominently posted in the media or online
     Answer Explanation:
     FINRA rules clarify that the whole block must be traded and reported for
     the information to be publicly available. Trading based on material
     information before this is front-running.

198) An investor enters a primary peg to sell 100 shares at $65.10 at a
     time when the best bid is $64.00, and the best offer is $65.25. If the
     best bid and best offer subsequently moves down to $63.10 and
     $65.00 respectively, what will the pegged order be repriced at?
      A) $63.10
      B) $65.00
      C) $65.10
      D) $65.25
     Answer Explanation:
     A primary peg to sell tracks the best offer. However, because the
     investor has a limit price of $65.10, the order will never be priced below
     that amount, even if the best offer moves lower than $65.10.

200) Which of the following methods may be used to obtain the consent
     of retail customers for net trades?
      A) Receive verbal consent from the client prior to the trade
      B) Provide the client with a negative consent letter prior to the trade
      C) Receive written consent from the client by settlement date of the
     transaction
      D) Receive written consent from the client prior to the trade
     Answer Explanation:
     For retail customers, authorizations must be obtained on a written order-
     by-order basis. This is different than for institutional customers, which
     allows for a negative consent letter, or written or verbal consent on a
     trade-by-trade basis.

204) On Monday, January 2nd, ABC Inc. declares a $0.10 dividend
     payable on Monday, Jan 16 to all shareholders of record as of
     Thursday, Jan 12. When will be the ex-dividend date for cash
     settled trades in the security?
      A) January 12
      B) January 10
      C) January 9
      D) January 13
     Answer Explanation:
     Cash settled trades settle on the same day. Therefore, an investor could
     buy stock on the record date and still settle in time to receive the
     dividend. Therefore, the ex-dividend date for a cash settled trade will be
     the business day after the record date.

205) A buy limit order has been placed for 5 shares. If a 3-for-2 stock
     split then occurs, how many shares will appear on the adjusted
     order, after the open on the ex-distribution date?
      A) 3
      B) 7
      C) 7.5
      D) 8
     Answer Explanation:
     Technically, a 3-for-2 stock split will produce 7.5 new shares. However, if
     the calculation produces a fractional number of shares, the order is
     adjusted down to the next whole number of shares. To calculate the new
     number of shares, multiply by the first number of the split and divide by
     the second: 5 x 3 / 2 = 7.5, which again, is rounded down to 7.
