*** seconds and
*** (usually) milliseconds.
** This is the time when parties to the transaction have agreed to all essential terms, including the actual price.

* within 10 seconds, .T
   This trade took place 4 milliseconds after the close of normal market hours. Note that without the millisecond digits, the trade would appear to be executed during normal market hours (i.e. at the close). However, in this case it is executed outside normal market hours but before 8:00 pm so it must be reported within 10 seconds because the trade reporting system is still open. If the report is timely (within the 10 seconds), the modifier is .T, if it was late, it would include a .U modifier.

* The member who submitted the original trade
   The member who originated each trade has responsibility for reporting its cancellation. This usually is the executing member.

* Member
   In transactions between a member and a non-member, the member must report the trade. Note that the member may be either the executing party or contra party.

* Below the prevailing market price
   The dealer's mark-down is added to the execution price to arrive at the reported trade price. For example, a customer sells 100 shares of ABC to broker dealer B at $10.00 inclusive of a $0.15 markdown. The trade report would indicate a price of $10.15.

* Both the time of execution and the time of the stop stock price
   For stock stop transactions, the trade report must include both the execution time and the time that the stop stock transaction was agreed to. The only exception is when the execution occurs within ten seconds of the stop stock price. In that case only the execution time is required on the trade report.

* within 10 seconds of execution.
   The TRF provides a mechanism for reporting trades. Trades executed during normal market hours must be reported within 10 seconds of execution.

* It will remain in the System, but will not be subject to the automatic lock-in process.
   If the contra party reviews a Trade Acceptance report and declines the trade, the report will remain in the System, but will not be subject to the automatic lock-in process.

* In no case\
   Individual executions of orders in a security at the same price may not be aggregated into a single transaction report for reporting purposes.

* Investor protection and public interest
   FINRA will grant an exemption to trade reporting only if four conditions are met, and also if the exemption is consistent with investor protection and the public interest. In such circumstances the "executing party" to the trade (typically the seller) is required to report the trade.

* Dark pool
   A dark pool is an ATS in which quotes and orders are concealed. Most orders are placed directly between large institutions.

* Only if execution is after 8:00 a.m.
   A pre-opening trade made before 8:00 a.m. must be reported by 8:15 a.m. EST. A pre-opening trade made after 8:00 EST must be reported within 10 seconds or else it is late.

* CAT
   The Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) replaced the old systems of the Order Audit Trail System (OATS) and the CBOE's Consolidated Options Audit Trail System (COATS), to provide an accurate, time-sequences record of orders, quotes and transactions. It allows regulators to recreate events in the life cycle of trades to review handling, execution and reporting.

* ATS
   The MPID identifies not only the member but also the ATS on which it is trading, if the member is operating multiple ATSs.

* On Form T
   Form T is used to submit last sale reports of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions in equity securities for which electronic submission is not possible. For example, a Form T submission may not be possible if the ticker symbol for the security is no longer available.

* Only if the trade is after 6:30 p.m. EST
   The last sale report for trades in ADF-eligible securities executed after 6:30 p.m. must be reported the following business day (T+1) by 8:15 a.m. EST. Trades that occur after market hours but


* $15.20

    On a trade report, the time of execution generally is expressed in hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds based on Eastern Time in military format, regardless of where the trade takes place or where the firm and client are located.

* Always
    In a give-up relationship, the trade is reported under the MPID of the executing firm, not the reporting firm.

* 06:05:57
    The execution at 6:05:47 pm must be reported within 10 seconds to avoid being late. So it must be reported by 6:05:57 pm.

* help regulators track events in the trade life cycle.
    The CAT system allows regulators to effectively and efficiently track events in the life cycle of a trade, thereby enhancing regulatory oversight of US securities markets.

* .P

* Mark-up or service charge
    In a principal trade, the reported purchase price must exclude the selling dealer's mark-up or service charge. So the $0.08 difference is attributable to the mark-up.

* the actual execution price along with a .P modifier.
    A .P modifier flags a late trade at a prior reference price. The report shows the actual 3:44 pm execution price along with the .P modifier.

* The other member is not identified in the initial trade report
    FINRA wants all participants in a riskless principal transaction to be identified. If the other participant is not identified in the initial tape report, the member must submit a non-tape report identifying the member. A non-tape report will ensure the trading volume is not double counted.

* $15.05
    When reporting principal transactions, any mark-down is excluded from the trade report. Therefore, the reported price of $15.20 does not include the $0.15 fee Jane pays the broker dealer for executing the transaction. Net of fees Jane will receive proceeds of $15.05 per share.

* customer orders only.
    Stop stock orders, in which the customer is promised a price for a short period of time, are allowed for customer orders only.

* 100 shares at $28.55
    In a principal trade, a mark-down by a buying dealer must be added back to the trade price. Here the mark-down was $0.10 so the reportable price is $28.45 + $0.10 = $28.55

* By the seller for regulatory transaction fee assessment purposes
    In this case the trade is not reported for publication but must be reported by the seller for regulatory fee assessment.

* One that does not permit automatic execution
    To qualify for exemption an ATS cannot permit automatic execution. It must require affirmative steps by subscribers to agree to a trade.

* an acceptable riskless principal trade.
    This offsets a customer order in a permissible riskless principal transaction.

* More than 10 seconds after execution
    The modifier indicates the trade report is late. For trades in normal market hours, late is more than 10 seconds after execution.

* The complexity of the trade
    FINRA considers several factors when determining consequences for late reporting including trade complexity.

* 22 calendar days after trade date
    Open orders are carried over through T+21 calendar days. On T+22 they remain in the system but are not subject to automatic lock-in.

* $66.75

* The cancellation must be reported by 8 PM the next business day.
    For trades executed between 9:30 AM and 4:00 PM and cancelled between 4:00 PM and 8:00 PM, best efforts must be made to report cancellation by 8:00 PM that day. Otherwise it must be reported by 8:00 PM the following business day.

* More than 10 seconds after execution

* Broker S, because it represents the sell-side
    Between two executing member parties, the sell-side reports the trade unless the parties agree otherwise.

* None
    In a dual agency transaction, only the number of shares and price are reported. Commissions are not included.

* $35.00
    When reporting principal sales, any mark-down is excluded from the trade report. So the full $35.00 price is reported, even though Jane receives only $34.70 after the $0.30 mark-down.

* Executing party
    Between member firms, the executing party reports the trade. If both are executing parties, the sell-side reports.

* Step-Out
    In a step-out, one broker executes a trade then allocates shares to the client's account at another broker.

* Requires a .U modifier
    Trades outside normal market hours reported late (more than 10 seconds) require a .U modifier.

* By 8:00 PM on May 16
    For an OTC equity trade cancelled before 8:00 pm on any date after the trade date, the cancellation must be reported by 8:00 pm that same cancellation date.

* 2:12 + 10 seconds
    The cancellation deadline is based on the earliest of: cancellation on books, notice to contra party, or agreement to cancel. Here the books were cancelled at 2:12 pm so the deadline is 2:12 + 10 seconds.
