7) A firm makes a market in 80 stocks, of which half are priced at $5 or
below and half are priced above $5. What is the firm's minimum net
capital requirement?

 A) $100,000
 B) $125,000
 C) $140,000

For firms registered as a market maker, the required minimum net capital is
a function of the number of stocks the firm is quoting, subject to a minimum
net capital of $100,000, regardless of the number of stocks being quoted.
For stocks with a bid price of $5 or less, the market maker must have a net
capital of $1,000 per security, and for stocks with a bid price of more than
$5, a market maker must have a minimum net capital of $2,500 per

40 stocks x $2,500, or $140,000 total. Note that this concept is not

order to buy 600 shares at 12.20 is entered and executed, what will
the quote be immediately after execution?

 A) 12.14
 B) 12.14
 C) 12.14

12.20; 25 x 11
12.19; 25 x 5
12.20; 19 x 5
12.19; 19 x 11

Answer Explanation:
The order is executed at the resting ask price of $12.19, but it does not
change the quoted price. It does absorb 600 shares of the resting ask, so
it reduces the ask size from 11 round lots (1,100 shares) to 5 round lots
(500 shares).

shares at 27.46, when will the customer's order be filled?

 A) Immediately
 B) After 4,000 shares are executed at the limit price or better
 C) After 10,000 shares are executed at the limit price or better
 D) As soon as another investor or market-maker is willing to pay the
limit price or better
Answer Explanation:
Because of time priority, limit orders always go "to the back of the line"
behind other limit orders waiting to fill at the same limit price (on the same
side). Because the customer has placed a sell limit order at $27.46, all
10,000 shares at that price must first be executed before the customer's
order will be filled.

without requiring adjustment
 C) The maximum percentage that all new quotes may be away from

Firms are not permitted to enter new quotes outside the designated
percentage. For example, if the Designated Percentage is 8%, and the
NBBO is 10.00-10.01, all new bids must be entered within 8% of the best
bid (from $9.20 and upwards) and all new asks must be within 8% of

What is the lowest bid MDS could enter?

 A) $1.00
 B) $7.00
 C) $8.00
 D) $9.20
Answer Explanation:
The Designated Percentage is the percentage that all new quotes must
be away from the current National Best Bid Offer (NBBO). If there is no
NBBO, the pricing obligation references the last reported sale. The
Designated Percentage is 8% if the stock is in the S&P 500 or Russell

$1.00 and 30% for all other stocks. The percentage on Tier 1 stocks,
however, increases during the market open period (9:30 a.m. to 9:45
a.m.) and market close period (3:35 p.m. - 4 p.m.) to 20%. Here, the NBB
is $10.00, the stock is on the S&P 500, and the bid is being entered in the

87) The NBBO on BRT, an S&P 500 stock, is 20.00 - 20.10. MDX is a
market maker and has an existing offer on the stock. What is the
highest possible value for MDX's offer?

 A) $20.10
 B) $22.00
 C) $27.20
 D) $27.62
Answer Explanation:
The Defined Limit is the percentage that existing quotes can deviate from
the current National Best Bid Offer (NBBO). If there is no NBBO, the
pricing obligation references the last reported sale. Firms must adjust any
quotes that that are more than the Defined Limit away from the NBBO.
The Defined Limit is 9.5% if the stock is in the S&P 500 or Russell 1000
(a Tier 1 stock); 29.5% if it is an NMS stock with a price greater than
$1.00 and 31.5% for all other stocks. Here, the NBO is $20.10, the stock
is on the S&P 500, and the offer is already in the system, so the most it
can be away from the NBO is the Defined Limit of 9.5%, or $22.0095
(rounded to $22.00).

 A) More than $25.69
 B) Exactly $25.64
 C) Less than $25.64
 D) Exactly $25.69
Answer Explanation:
By placing a market order to buy Brian's will buy shares at the national
best offer, plus pay his firm a fee. Here, the market is $25.64-$25.69, so
Brian will buy shares from to the lowest priced seller at $25.69 plus pay
for the brokerage. Therefore, the best estimate will be more than $25.69
per share.

capital requirement?

 A) $70,000
 B) $100,000
 C) $150,000
 D) $1,000,000
Answer Explanation:
For firms registered as a market maker, the required minimum net capital
is a function of the number of stocks the firm is quoting, subject to a
minimum net capital of $100,000, regardless of the number of stocks
being quoted. For stocks with a bid price of $5 or less, the market maker
must have a net capital of $1,000 per security, and for stocks with a bid
price of more than $5, a market maker must have a minimum net capital
of $2,500 per security. In this case, the firm is required to have 20 stocks
x $1,000 and 20 stocks x $2,500, or $70,000 total. Remember, however,
that the minimum net capital is still $100,000 for a market maker
regardless of the number of stock being quoted. Note that this concept is

113) KKF Securities, a FINRA registered market maker is displaying a
quote in a Nasdaq listed security of 7-8 4x5. A customer of the firm
contacts his registered rep and asks to have the quote explained to
him. Which of the following is the best explanation?

 A) KKF will sell shares at $8 per share for 400 shares
 B) KKF will sell shares at $7 per share for 400 shares
 C) KKF will sell shares at $7 per share for 500 shares
 D) KKF will sell shares at $8 per share for 500 shares

The market maker's quote of 7-8 4x5 indicates the firm bid-ask and the
number of shares available at those prices: 4 round lots (400 shares) at
the bid and 5 round lots (500 shares) at the offer. The bid is the price the
firm will pay to buy shares. The ask is where the firm will sell shares.
Thus, the best explanation of the firm's quote here is that KKF is offering
(asking or selling) shares at $8 per share, and will do so for 5 round lots.

the lowest bid MDS could enter?
