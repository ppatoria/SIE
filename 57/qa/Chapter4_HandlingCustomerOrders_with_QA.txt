## 4 Handling Customer Orders

```
Market makers are the link between parties in the capital markets. They accept,
display, and execute customers’ orders and simultaneously stand ready to buy
and sell securities for their own accounts so that there is liquidity and transpar-
ency in the equity markets. In fulfilling these roles, however, market makers must
follow specific rules and guidelines to treat customers fairly and with the highest
standards of commercial honor.
This chapter will cover the following information:
◆ Types of orders
◆ Displaying and protecting customer limit orders
◆ Prohibited trading practices
◆ Adjustment of orders
◆ Trade settlement
```
### 4.1 FINRA’s Conduct Rule

```
FINRA Rule 2110 is FINRA’s Conduct Rule, one of the most important regulatory
standards in the US securities industry. This rule embodies FINRA’s Standards
of Commercial Honor and Principles of Trade, and in just 22 words, it provides
an overarching principle for all securities professionals:
```
“A member, in the conduct of its business, shall observe high standards of com-
mercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.”
There are no universally agreed-upon definitions for terms such as “high stan-
dards” or “just and equitable.” Therefore, the Conduct Rule is fundamentally sub-
jective. This gives FINRA broad power to enforce the rule. The information in
this chapter will discuss the various rules and regulations governing how FINRA
firms can and must interact with their customers.

### 4.2 Types of Orders

```
Investors who enter orders with a firm can provide specific instructions that
govern how their orders must be executed.
```

Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

#### 4.2.1 Market Orders

```
A market order is an order to buy or sell stock at the best available price. The
intent of a market order is to have immediate execution at the current price,
whatever that may be. Market orders are said to guarantee execution, but not
guarantee price.
A market order indicates that the customer wants immediate execution. In
order to do so, a customer desiring to sell would need to “accept” the best bid.
Conversely, a customer desiring to buy would need to do so at the offer price,
since this is the amount at which a seller is immediately willing to sell the stock.
```
```
Example
An investor enters an order to buy 100 shares of ABC stock at the market.
When the order reaches the market, the NBBO is 75.47–.49. In this instance,
the order will be executed at 75.49, since that is the lowest price at which
someone is willing to sell the shares (the best offer).
```
```
Similarly, a market order to sell would be executed at the best bid, here $75.47,
since that is the most an investor will currently pay. Put another way, for an
investor who wants to sell the stock immediately, the best bid represents the
most a customer can receive.
```
```
To use a term discussed earlier, market orders cross the spread , meaning they
execute against the best price on the other side of the market.
This table summarizes how market orders are executed.
```
```
Type of Order Execution Price
Market order to sell Highest bid
Market order to buy Lowest offer
```
```
Knopman Note: A client choosing to “hit the bid” is saying they want
to place a market order to sell. Conversely, “lifting the offer” is a market
order to buy.
```
```
In fast-moving markets, however, the price at which a market order will execute
may deviate significantly from the last-traded price or real-time quote , and
many exchanges restrict customers’ ability to place true market orders—instead
customers will use collared orders.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
Example
The NBBO is 8.00–8.25. Customer A enters a limit order to buy at $8.25.
Simultaneously, Customer B enters a market order to sell. Where does each
customer get executed?
```
```
Customer A’s limit buy order at $8.25 can be executed with Customer B’s
market order to sell, and both get filled at $8.25.
```
```
Notice that both customers get filled at the same $8.25 price.
```
#### 4.2.2 Collared Orders

During normal market operations, Nasdaq converts customer market orders into
collared orders. A **collared order** refers to any unpriced order entered into the
system. To protect customers from extreme price volatility, the order (or any por-
tion thereof ) is cancelled if it would be executed more than $0.25 or 5% away from
the inside market at the time the order reaches the system, whichever is greater.

```
Example
A customer enters an order to buy 5,000 shares when the inside market is
87.30–88.00. In this case, the 5% collar is calculated off the best offer of 88.00,
equal to $4.40. By the time the order reaches the market, the best available
price is $92.50. Because this is more than 5% away from the $88 best offer at
the time of order entry, the order is cancelled. The collar is based off the 5%
rather than $0.25 since 5% of the inside is greater than $0.25.
```
```
Example
A customer enters a market order to sell 3,000 shares when the inside market
is 4.00–4.05. Here, the collar is $0.25 away from 4.00 ($3.75) because that is
greater than 5% of 4.00 ($0.20). At the time of execution, the market is:
```
```
MM Size Bid
MMAA 20 3.80
MMBB 10 3.70
MMCC 8 3.65
```
```
The firm can sell 2,000 shares at $3.80 and the other 1,000 shares can be sold at
$3.70. In this case, 2,000 would be executed at $3.80 but the remaining portion
of the order must be cancelled because $3.70 is more than $0.25 away from
the inside market at the time of order entry.
```
During a cross (open, closing, or halt), traditional market orders (i.e., without a
collar) can be entered.


Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

#### 4.2.3 Limit Orders

```
A buy limit order specifies the maximum price at which an order can be filled,
while a sell limit order specifies a minimum price that will be accepted.
```
```
Example
A customer enters an order to “buy 100 shares at $45.50 limit.” The order will
only be executed at $45.50 or below.
```
```
Knopman Note: If an investor places a limit order that specifies that
they want a certain price, including the commission, the broker-dealer
must place the order at a better price of its choosing so that the all-in
price to the customer does not exceed the customer’s specifications. For
example, if a customer says, “I want to pay no more than $30, including
the commission,” the broker-dealer might choose to place the order at
$29, thereby allowing room for a $1 commission. This must be clearly
explained to the customer.
```
```
Limit orders will not be filled if the required price is not available. If the order
is not filled during the trading day, it is automatically cancelled at the close of
trading unless the customer has specified a time in force (discussed shortly).
A marketable limit order is one that can be filled immediately upon order entry
given the current market price.
```
```
Example
A customer enters an order to buy 300 shares at $75.81 when the best offer is
$74.90 for 10 round lots. Since the customer is willing to pay up to $75.81 and
the shares are available at a cheaper price ($0.91 cheaper), the order can be
executed immediately at $74.90 and can be described as a marketable limit
order.
```
```
If the limit order is not marketable when entered, that quote will generally be
displayed by the market maker as a quote available for execution. Rules regarding
limit order display will be discussed shortly.
```
```
Example
A customer enters an order to buy 300 shares at $75.81 with MMAA when the
best offer is $75.88 for 10 round lots. Because this order is not marketable, the
market maker will enter the customer’s limit order for display on the system.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
Knopman Note: When a firm is holding multiple customer limit orders,
the priority in which they will be filled is 1) price, 2) time of entry, and 3)
order size (largest order first).
Also, if a customer places a limit order that is marketable at the time
of order entry but is not marketable by the time the order reaches
the market, the broker-dealer would continue to hold the order as a
traditional “resting” limit order.
```
```
Example
A customer enters an order to buy 100 at $82 when the market is 81 × 82. By
the time the order reaches the market, the inside market has moved to 82 ×
```
83. In this case, the broker-dealer should continue to represent the customer’s
    limit order to buy at 82.

#### 4.2.4 Stop Orders

A **stop order** is a specific order instruction that allows an investor to control
when the order will be executed. Stop orders are two-step orders:
◆ **Step 1** : The stock trades at or through a designated stop price.
◆ **Step 2** : The order is activated, elected, or triggered and becomes a market
order. As a market order, it will immediately execute at the best available
price (the best bid for sell stop orders; the best offer for buy stop orders).

```
Knopman Note: A stop order entered good ’til cancelled (GTC) can
be activated by the opening price the next day and then subsequently
executed.
```
#### 4.2.5 Buy Stop Orders

A buy stop order is entered at a stop price above the market price. It can be used
to protect a profit or limit a loss on a short stock position.

```
Example
A customer enters an order to “buy 400 shares XYZ at $32.50 STOP.” Once
XYZ trades at or above $32.50, the stop order will activate. Once activated,
the order (now a market order) will execute at the best offer. Here, assume at
the moment after activation the quote is 32.49–32.57. Therefore, the shares
will be purchased at $32.57.
```
```
Buy stop orders are commonly placed to protect a short position. For example,
an investor who sells stock short at $60 might place a buy stop at $80 to cover
the short if the stock moves in the wrong direction.
```

Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

```
Example
An investor sold short 1,000 shares of ABC stock at $37. Now, the current share
price is $34, providing the investor with an unrealized profit of $3 per share. To
avoid a loss, which will occur if the price rises higher than $37 per share, the
investor enters instructions to “buy 1,000 shares of ABC, stop at $36.50.” If ABC
trades at $36.50 or above, the order will trigger into a market order, and the
shares will be bought at the next available price (i.e., the lowest offer).
```
#### 4.2.6 Sell Stop Orders

```
Similarly, a stop order to sell becomes a market order when a transaction occurs
at or below the stop price. A sell stop can be used to protect a long position in a
declining market.
```
```
Example
An investor owns 100 shares of PSL at $92 and is going on an extended vaca-
tion. If the price falls as low as $85, she wants out of the stock. She can enter
an order to “sell 100 shares of PSL, stop $85,” and if PSL drops to $85, the stop
order will convert into a market sell order and automatically liquidate her
position at the next available price.
```
#### 4.2.7 Stop Limit Orders

```
A stop limit order combines a stop price (to trigger the order) with a limit price
at which the transaction must be executed. Put differently, once activated, the
order converts into a limit order rather than a market order.
```
```
Example
An investor enters an order to “buy 400 shares stop at $32.50, limit at $32.75.”
Any transaction at or above $32.50 will trigger into a limit order to buy 400
shares at $32.75. In this case, the investor is assured of buying the shares at a
price no higher than $32.75.
```
```
One risk associated with stop limit orders is that the order can trigger but not
execute—this is referred to as an order being activated, but not executed. To
continue with the example above, if the order was activated by a trade at $32.71
but the shares were never subsequently available at $32.75 or below, the limit
price could not be satisfied and the order would not be executed.
```
```
Example
An investor enters an order to “buy 800 shares stop at $12.52, limit at $12.60.”
The stock then trades: $12.40, $12.49, $12.55 (activation), $12.62. Notice the
order is activated at $12.55, but the stock is never available for purchase at
$12.60 or less. Therefore, this order would activate but not execute.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
4.2.7.1 Entry of Limit and Stop Orders
When entering limit and stop orders, customers must follow certain guidelines
relating to whether the stop price must be above or below the current market
value.
```
```
Below the Market Above the Market
Buy limit Sell limit
Sell stop Buy stop
Sell stop limit Buy stop limit
```
```
Stop orders that do not follow the above guidelines would immediately activate,
which is why they cannot be entered as such.
```
#### 4.2.8 Discretionary Orders

```
Example
A customer places an order to buy 1,000 shares at $74.83 with a discretionary
range of $0.06. The system displays a bid of $74.83, but the buyer is actually
willing to pay up to $74.89.
```
The order will only execute in the discretionary range **if necessary** , meaning a
priced order on the other side of the market is displayed or an execution takes
place within the discretionary range. If one of those two events occurs, the discre-
tionary order becomes an **immediate-or-cancel order** (IOC; discussed shortly)
at the highest price (or lowest price for a sell order) of the discretionary range.

```
Example
A customer places an order to sell 300 shares at $12.34, with a discretionary
range of $0.03, meaning the customer will sell for as low as $12.31. If a dis-
played bid comes in at $12.32, the discretionary order becomes an IOC order
to sell at $12.31 and could be executed against the $12.32 bid.
```
```
In the case that more than one discretionary order becomes an IOC order, pri-
ority is given to the first order that reaches the interest on the other side of the
market. If the discretionary order becomes an IOC order but is not executed,
the unexecuted portion reverts to a discretionary order with a new time stamp.
```
The discretionary range is not relevant when trades are executed against market
orders. It might be helpful to think of the apartment example again here: For a
purchaser bidding $200,000 but willing to pay $220,000, if the seller accepts the
$200,000 bid, the buyer won’t say, “By the way, I’m willing to pay $220,000.”

```
Example
If the customer had placed the same order to sell 300 shares at $12.34 with a dis-
cretionary range of $0.03, and a market order to buy 300 shares was presented,
the orders would execute against each other at the displayed price of $12.34.
```

Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

#### 4.2.9 Pegged Orders

```
Customers may wish to enter orders that move up and down as the price of the
stock changes. Pegged orders allow them to automate this process. A pegged
order will adjust up or down based on the best bid, the best offer, or the bid–ask
midpoint. These customer pegged orders are distinct from the market maker peg
used by member firms to meet their quotation requirements.
A primary peg order will match the same side of the market, meaning a primary
peg to buy will equal the inside bid. Conversely, a primary peg to sell will equal
the inside offer. Primary peg orders are displayed.
A market peg order will match the opposite side of the market, meaning a mar-
ket peg to buy will equal the inside offer, and a market peg to sell will equal the
inside bid. Market peg orders are so called because they are immediately mar-
ketable, provided enough available interest exists on the other side of the market.
Market peg orders are displayed.
A midpoint peg order, which will always be undisplayed, will equal the midpoint
of the best bid and offer. Midpoint peg orders can execute in sub-penny incre-
ments to obtain the midpoint price.
```
```
Example
The inside market for ABC stock is 75.20–.25. A midpoint peg buy order would
be an undisplayed bid that would execute at 75.225, the exact midpoint of the
bid and ask, provided that there is interest on the other side of the market to
facilitate the trade (e.g., the midpoint peg bid is $75.225—if a sell limit order
was entered at $72.21, the order would execute at $72.225).
```
```
Pegged orders can be set with a limit price beyond which the order will not be
adjusted.
```
```
Example
An investor enters a primary peg to sell 100 shares with a limit price of $55.10
at a time when the best offer is $55.25. At order entry, the order will automat-
ically be priced at the best offer of $55.25. The best offer subsequently moves
down to $55.15, causing the pegged order to reset to $55.15. Then, the best offer
moves again, to $55.05. In this case, the pegged order will go down to $55.10,
but not lower, since that is the limit price.
```
```
Primary and midpoint peg orders can also include offset amounts that will keep
the order price a certain interval away from the pegged price.
```
```
Example
An investor places a midpoint peg to buy 400 shares with an offset of $0.02 at
a time when the inside market is 10.52–.58. At order entry, the pegged order
will be priced at $10.57, $0.02 above the bid–ask midpoint of $10.55. The inside
market subsequently moves to 10.52–.60. Therefore, the midpoint peg will
move to $10.58, $0.02 above the new midpoint of $10.56.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
Pegged orders will generally be displayed on the Nasdaq system, with two
exceptions:
◆ Midpoint peg orders are not displayed, and
◆ Primary peg orders with an offset amount are not displayed
```
```
Knopman Note: There are three types of pegged orders: primary peg,
market peg, and midpoint peg. Any order with a limit price is not
necessarily a pegged order. A pegged order is a special type of limit order
that automatically adjusts as the market moves.
```
#### 4.2.10 Minimum Quantity Orders

A **minimum quantity order** (sometimes abbreviated MAQ for minimum accept-
able quantity) is an order where the customer specifies a minimum number of
acceptable shares for execution. The order will not execute unless the customer
can get at least that many shares.

```
Example
A customer enters an order to buy 1,000 shares of ABC at $32.45 MAQ 300.
Subsequently, 200 shares become available at $32.45. In this case, the order
will not be executed because the customer requires at least 300 shares.
```
```
If the number of shares remaining after an execution is less than the MAQ spec-
ified in the order, the MAQ is reduced to the number of shares remaining.
```
```
Example
A customer enters an order to buy 1,000 shares of ABC at $32.45 MAQ 300.
Subsequently, 800 shares become available at $32.45. Since the 800 shares
are acceptable to the customer, the trade will be executed, thereby leaving
200 shares unexecuted. The order’s MAQ will be adjusted downward from
300 shares to 200 shares.
```
```
MAQ orders can also be entered to permit multiple simultaneous executions to
meet the minimum quantity. MAQ orders are non-displayed orders in Nasdaq.
```
#### 4.2.11 Other Order Types

In recent years, brokerage firms have competed for institutional volume by
offering alternative order types, including a version of stop and stop limit orders
that are not triggered by execution prices but instead by quotes or other criteria.
This caused confusion and errors when these stop-like orders were entered and
routed to firms that did not use or understand the newer order types. These types
of orders can also confuse clients, who may think they are traditional stop orders.


Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

```
FINRA Rule 5350 aims to clarify the situation. The rule applies to NMS and OTC
equity securities. The rule:
◆ Requires that any orders labeled either stop or stop limit be triggered
based on actual executions. They cannot be triggered by any other
market event (quotes, averages, etc.).
◆ Permits brokerage firms to offer alternative order types with different
triggers, provided that the order is not labeled stop or stop limit and is
clearly distinguishable. For example, a firm could call an order triggered
by a quote a “stop-quote” order.
◆ Requires written disclosure to customers, prior to order execution, that
provides a clear description of the alternative order type and triggering
events
◆ Clarifies that member firms are not obligated to accept stop, stop limit,
or other types of triggered orders
Firms that do route stop or stop limit orders to other broker-dealers or exchanges
must take reasonable steps to ensure that the orders are handled properly and
in accordance with the order parameters.
```
#### 4.2.12 Time in Force

```
Time in force describes when the system will make an order available for exe-
cution. If a customer does not specify a specific time in force, the order will be
treated as a day order. Orders can be defined as market hours day orders or
system hours day orders. Market hours are 9:30 am–4:00 pm. System hours are
4:00 am–8:00 pm.
```
```
Knopman Note: Nasdaq system hours are 4:00 am to 8:00 pm.
```
```
4.2.12.1 Market Hours Day (MDAY)
A market hours day (MDAY) order is the default order type. An MDAY order
is executable between 9:30 am and 4:00 pm on the day the order is entered. Any
portion not executed by 4:00 pm is cancelled.
```
```
4.2.12.2 Market Hours Good ’Til Cancelled (GTC)
A good ’til cancelled (GTC) order is available for execution during market hours
for one full year from the date of order entry, unless it is executed or cancelled
by the customer.
```
```
Knopman Note: A good ’til cancelled (GTC) order is an order to buy or
sell a stock that remains on the limit order book (“the book”) until the
order is executed or cancelled.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
4.2.12.3 Market Hours Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC or MIOC)
An immediate-or-cancel (IOC) or a market hours immediate-or-cancel
(MIOC) order must be filled immediately after order entry. Any portion of the
order (including potentially the entire order) that cannot be immediately satis-
fied is cancelled. IOC and MIOC orders do allow for partial executions. The order
can only be entered and executed during normal market hours.
```
```
Example
Joe enters an order to buy 3,000 shares at $75 IOC. At the time of order entry,
2,000 shares are available at $75. Joe will purchase 2,000 shares, and the
firm will cancel the rest of the order since only 2,000 shares were available
immediately.
```
```
4.2.12.4 System Hours Day (SDAY)
System hours day (SDAY) orders are available for execution from 4:00 am–8:00
pm on the day the order is entered.
```
```
4.2.12.5 System Hours Good ’Til Cancelled
System hours GTC orders are available for execution from 4:00 am–8:00 pm
every day for one year, or until the order is cancelled.
```
```
4.2.12.6 System Hours Immediate-or-Cancel (SIOC)
System hours immediate-or-cancel (SIOC) orders can be executed anytime
from 4:00 am–8:00 pm but will be cancelled unless at least a portion of the order
is marketable upon order entry. Any portion that is not immediately marketable
will be cancelled.
```
```
4.2.12.7 Good ’Til Market Close (GTMC)
Good ’til market close (GTMC) orders are available for execution until 4:00
pm, ET. If the order is not executed on the continuous book during the day, it
will participate in the closing cross, after which any unexecuted portion will be
cancelled. If a GTMC order is entered after the closing cross, it will be treated as
a system hours IOC order.
```
**4.2.12.8 System Hours Expire Time (SHEX)
System hours expire time (SHEX) orders** allow the customer to specify the
exact time in force. For example, the customer could state “good for an hour,”
“good for a week,” or “good for a month.” Orders are available for entry and execu-
tion anytime the system is open (4:00 am–8:00 pm).


Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

#### 4.3 Paperwork for Customer Orders

```
Having reviewed the various order types available to customers, the next step is
to understand how these orders are communicated to and captured by the firm.
This section will discuss order tickets (pre-execution) and trade confirmations
(post-execution).
```
##### 4.3.1 Order Tickets

```
Upon receiving an order from a customer, a firm must complete an order ticket
(i.e., order memorandum) , which includes the following key terms of the order:
◆ Stock name
◆ Price instructions (if any)
◆ Whether it is a buy or sell order
◆ Number of shares
◆ Order instructions (market, limit, stop, etc.)
◆ Customer account number
◆ Time of order receipt, entry, and execution
◆ Identity of the registered rep(s) responsible for the account
◆ Identity of the person who entered and accepted the order from the
customer, or a notation that it was entered electronically
◆ Execution price
◆ Notation if the order was executed on a discretionary basis
◆ Notation if the order was executed on an unsolicited basis
```
```
Knopman Note: Key things to know about order tickets:
An order ticket must specifically note whether an order was entered as
a discretionary or an unsolicited order. It is a violation to inappropriately
mark a solicited trade as unsolicited or discretionary. Here is a summary
of the ways that orders can be received:
```
- Unsolicited—The client initiates the trade on his own.
- Solicited—The securities professional suggests or recommends the
    transaction, and the client approves it.
- Discretionary—The securities professional is authorized to place
    trades on the client’s behalf.

```
The time of entry is defined as the time when the firm transmits the order
or instruction for execution.
CUSIP numbers are not required on the order ticket.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
##### 4.3.2 Trade Confirmations

Broker-dealers are required to provide written confirmations of trades to cus-
tomers at or before completion of a transaction, which is defined as **settlement**.

Under SEC Rule 10b-10, required information on the customer **trade confirma-
tion** includes:

```
◆ Broker-dealer’s name and address
◆ Whether the trade was a purchase or a sale
◆ Price
◆ Complete description of the security, including name and CUSIP (a
security’s unique identification number)
◆ Number of shares
◆ Trade settlement date
◆ Time of the trade or a statement that the time is available upon request
◆ Delivery and payment instructions
◆ Capacity of the broker-dealer (agent or principal)
```
- If acting as principal, whether the firm is a market maker in the
    security
- If acting as principal and executing on a net basis or riskless
    principal basis, the difference between the price to the customer and
    the price to the broker-dealer for the offsetting leg
- If acting as principal, the difference between the price to the
    customer and the reported transaction price (i.e., the mark-up or
    mark-down)
- If acting as agent, the commission
- If acting as agent, any other remuneration received in connection
    with the transaction (e.g., payment for order flow)
◆ Market where the trade was effected
◆ Any control relationships between the issuer of the securities and the
firm
◆ Whether an odd-lot fee was assessed and disclosure that the amount of
the fee will be disclosed upon request


Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

```
Knopman Note:
```
```
Q: Is the time of execution required on an order confirmation?
A: The order ticket must include the time of execution, whereas the trade
confirmation may, but is not required to.
```
```
Q: What is not required on a trade confirmation?
A: Order receipt time is not required on a trade confirmation.
```
```
Q: How detailed is the order flow disclosure on the order confirmation?
A: Trade confirms must indicate whether the broker-dealer received
payment for order flow for the transaction. The specific source and
nature of the payment for order flow are furnished only upon the
customer’s written request.
```
```
If the customer does request any information offered on a trade confirmation
(e.g., transaction time, amount of odd-lot fee), the broker-dealer has five business
days to provide this information. If the transaction occurred more than 30 days
prior to the request, the broker-dealer has 15 business days to provide the data.
```
```
4.3.2.1 Alternative Periodic Reporting
Broker-dealers may execute transactions for a client without providing a trans-
action-specific trade confirmation in certain limited circumstances:
◆ The client trades are executed pursuant to a periodic plan, such that
transactions occur at previously agreed to intervals and quantities, or
◆ The transactions are for money market fund clients
```

4.3.2.2 Delivery of Quarterly Statements
Clients who trade under a periodic plan and do not receive confirmations for
each transaction must receive a written statement of transactions on a quarterly
basis. The quarterly statement must be delivered within five days of quarter end.
Money market fund clients must receive this statement after the end of each
month.
The written statement can be delivered either to the customer or to another per-
son chosen by the customer. The written statement must include the following
information for the period:
◆ Securities transactions along with the date, ticker, price, and quantity
◆ Dividends and distributions
◆ Total number of shares of each security that was traded
◆ Remuneration paid to the broker-dealer
◆ A notice that all information provided on traditional trade confirmations
is available upon request

#### 4.4 Display of Customer Limit Orders

```
With the goal of transparency and fairness across marketplaces, member firms
have an obligation to display both their own quotes and the priced limit orders
(i.e., priced orders) of their customers for both listed securities (NMS stock) and
OTC equities. The Limit Order Display Rule , codified as Regulation NMS Rule
604 , applies to NMS stocks while FINRA Rule 6460 applies to OTC equities. Both
rules require market makers to display quotes, including the price and size, to
the entire marketplace, subject to certain exceptions. The general rules for limit
order display are as follows:
◆ If a customer’s order improves the market maker’s price, the firm must
update its quote to reflect the order.
◆ If a customer’s order is at the inside market (best bid or best offer), the
firm must adjust its displayed size to include the firm’s size plus the
customer’s size. Note that for OTC stocks, the inside market is based
upon the best bid or best offer on that particular venue, whereas for
NMS stocks, it is the NBBO. An exception is available, however, if the
customer’s size represents a de minimis change in the market maker’s
size, in which case the firm’s size need not be adjusted. A de minimis
change for these purposes is defined as no more than 10% of the market
maker’s displayed quote size.
```
Additional exceptions allow a firm to not display a customer’s order at all. The
display rule does not apply to any customer limit order that:
◆ Is executed on receipt (marketable)
◆ The customer requests not to be displayed
◆ Is an odd-lot order (generally less than 100 shares)
◆ Is a block size order (greater than 10,000 shares or $200,000), unless a
customer placing the order requests that the order be displayed (Note:
For OTC equities, a block is defined as 10,000 shares and at least $100,000
in value.)

```
Example
An order of 10,000 shares at $10 per share (total value of $100,000) would
constitute a block order in the OTC markets.
```
```
Knopman Note: When executing a block trade (e.g., an order to buy
15,000 shares) a market maker can display or show an indication of less
than the full 15,000 shares. For example, showing a quote or indication of
10,000 shares would be permissible.
```
```
◆ Is delivered immediately upon receipt to a national securities exchange,
a national securities association-sponsored system, or an electronic
communications network
```

Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

```
◆ Is delivered immediately upon receipt to another exchange member or to
an OTC market maker that complies with these requirements
◆ Is an all-or-none order
```
```
Knopman Note: Make sure to review the exceptions to limit order display
detailed above.
```
```
Absent an exception, a market maker must update its quote within 30 seconds
to reflect a customer’s order.
```
```
Knopman Note: On the exam, unless an exception is presented within
a question, always assume that a market maker is required to display a
customer’s limit order.

##### 4.4.1 Orders Improving a Market Maker’s Quote

```
Given the market above, a customer subsequently contacts Market Maker A
(MMAA) and places an order to buy 3,000 shares of ABCC at 10.43. MMAA is cur-
rently bidding 10.42. Since this order improves the market maker’s quote, from
.42 to .43, the market maker must update its quote to reflect the full price and
size of the customer’s order. Therefore, MMAA is now alone at the best bid, and
the market for ABCC is reflected as:
```
```

MMBB 10.40 41 28 10.47 MMAA
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
The new quote is outlined for emphasis. The 10.43 bid reflects the customer’s
interest in purchasing the stock at that price. Put another way, the market maker
is bidding, as agent, on behalf of the customer.
Note that MMAA’s previous high bid at 10.42 remains available for execution but
is no longer the best bid. Also, the new bid has impacted the inside market, which
is now 10.43–.44 30 × 51.
If a customer had placed an order to sell stock at a specific price, the order would
have updated the ask side rather than the bid side.

##### 4.4.2 Orders Impacting a Market Maker’s Size

MMBB 10.40 41 35 10.46 MMBB
MMCC 10.40 38 28 10.47 MMAA
```
A customer places an order with MMAA to buy 3,000 shares at 10.42. The market
maker is already bidding on shares at that price. So, MMAA will add the size of
the customer’s order to its own existing bid size of 2,200 shares. The resulting
market is as follows, with the updated quote outlined and the new quote size
bolded:

```
```
MMAA receives an order from a customer to sell 1,500 shares of ABCC stock at
10.45. MMAA is currently showing an offer of 10.45. Therefore, this quote does
not improve MMAA’s price; rather, it only impacts its size. Since the price of 10.45
is not at the inside offer of 10.44, the market maker does not need to update its
quote to reflect this order.
Note that if the .44 offer is executed, and the .45 offer becomes the new best offer,
MMAA is required to immediately update its offer to reflect the customer’s order.
Put another way, if an existing quote becomes the inside market, all sizes at that
price must be displayed.
```
```
Knopman Note: An order that only impacts the market maker’s size must
only be reflected in a quote if that price is at the inside market.
```
##### 4.4.4 Orders for a De Minimis Size

```
The previous example illustrates that orders that impact a market maker’s size
must only be reflected in a quote that is at the inside market. An exception is
available for orders that are no more than a de minimis size in relation to the
market maker’s quote size. De minimis size is defined as 10% or less of the market
maker’s displayed order size.

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
A customer contacts MMAA and places an order to buy 200 shares at 10.42. 10.42
is at the inside market, which normally requires the full size to be reflected in the
quote. However, as this order is for less than 220 shares (i.e., 10% of the current
displayed size for MMAA at 10.42), MMAA can choose not to display the order.
For purposes of the de minimis exemption, a market maker is required to aggre-
gate all customer orders that are less than 10% of the current quote size. Once
those orders, in aggregate, equal or exceed 10% of the current quote size, the
market maker must update its quote to reflect the orders.

```
Example
In the market above, MMAA is bidding 10.42 on 2,200 shares (22 round lots).
MMAA is not required to display an order received for 200 shares at 10.42,
since this is de minimis. However, if MMAA were to subsequently receive
another order to buy 100 shares at 10.42, it would be required to update its
size to reflect both orders, since the total of three round lots reflected by these
two orders is no longer de minimis.

```
A customer contacts MMAA to buy 1,300 shares of ABCC stock at 10.44. A quick
review of the offer side of the market indicates that this is a **marketable limit
order** , meaning there is a counterparty willing to accept the customer’s bid price.
MMBB is at the best offer of 10.44 and has time priority, as indicated by its posi-
tion at the top of the screen. Therefore, it will execute the order for the 1,300
shares the customer is interested in purchasing and will **decrement** , or reduce,
its offer size from 2,700 to 1,400, as indicated here:

#### 4.5 Trading Ahead of Customer Limit Orders (Manning Rule)

```
FINRA Rule 5320, often referred to as the Manning Rule , prohibits a FINRA mem-
ber firm from placing the firm’s trading interest ahead of a client’s in both NMS
stocks and OTC equity securities. The Manning Rule is also referred as the Limit
Order Protection Rule.
The rule goes beyond limit order display. It requires that a firm not only display
a customer’s order, but also execute the customer’s order in a particular manner.
Specifically, Manning prohibits a member from trading for its own account at a
price that is equal to or better than an unexecuted customer limit order in that
security, unless the member immediately thereafter executes the customer limit
order at the same or better price for at least the same number of shares. For the
purposes of Manning (FINRA Rule 5320), immediately is interpreted as within
60 seconds.
```
```
Example
Broker-Dealer ABC is holding a customer’s order to buy 5,000 shares of XYZ
stock at $37. If Broker-Dealer ABC purchases 2,000 shares of ABC for its own
inventory at $37, it must immediately thereafter (within 60 seconds) fill the
customer’s order for 2,000 shares at $37 or better. The effect of these two
transactions is that the customer gets the 2,000 available shares.
```
```
If the firm executes an order at a price superior to the customer’s price, it must
give the customer at least that price.
```
```
Example
Broker-Dealer ABC is holding a customer’s order to buy 5,000 shares of XYZ
stock at $37. If ABC purchases 2,000 shares of XYZ for its own inventory at $36,
it must immediately thereafter fill the customer’s order for 2,000 shares at $36.
A customer bidding $37 would certainly accept a price of $36. Therefore, the
customer must be filled at that price.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
If, however, the broker-dealer trades for its own account at a price that is inferior
to the customer’s price, it is not required to fill the customer order.

```
Example
Broker-Dealer ABC is holding a customer’s order to buy 5,000 shares of XYZ
stock at $37. If ABC purchases 2,000 shares of XYZ for its own inventory at $38,
it does not need to fill the customer’s order. A customer bidding $37 would
not be willing to pay $38. Therefore, there is no Manning obligation to the
customer.
```
Customer limit orders must be protected during normal market hours of 9:30
am–4:00 pm. If a customer has been granted authority to trade outside normal
market hours, the customer’s orders must be protected at all times that the trade
could be executed.

##### 4.5.1 Exceptions to the Manning Rule

FINRA Rule 5320 offers a number of exceptions to the trading-ahead rule.

```
4.5.1.1 Trading Along
```
FINRA Rule 5320 lets firms execute orders for their own accounts without trig-
gering a Manning obligation if certain requirements are satisfied. When these
requirements are met, a firm is said to be **trading along** with the customer’s order.

Trading along is only permitted for institutional accounts or for **large orders** ,
defined as at least 10,000 shares and $100,000 in value (note: the large order defi-
nition is slightly different than the block order definition of $200,000). Also, in
order to trade along, the broker-dealer must disclose to the customer at account
opening, and annually thereafter, that it may make proprietary trades at prices
that would satisfy a customer’s order but will not in fact execute the client’s order.
Furthermore, the firm must give clients an opportunity to opt in to the Limit
Order Protection Rule on an order-by-order basis.

Even if the broker-dealer does not provide the disclosures at account opening
and annually thereafter, it can _still_ trade along, provided it makes clear verbal
disclosure and receives written consent on an order-by-order basis.

```
Example
CST Pension Fund places an order to buy 15,000 shares of ABC stock at $75
with BD XYZ. XYZ notifies all institutional clients at account opening and
annually that it may trade along with their orders. Therefore, XYZ could pur-
chase shares of ABC at $75 for its own account without filling the order for
the pension fund.
```

_Chapter 4_
Handling
Customer Orders

```
Example
Broker-Dealer DEF notifies all of its clients that it may trade along with their
orders. Notifications are provided both at account opening and annually.
Joe, a retail client, places an order to buy 5,000 shares of XYZ for $18. DEF
subsequently purchases 4,000 shares of XYZ at $18 without executing any of
Joe’s order.
```
```
This is a violation. Even though the firm made appropriate disclosures, trad-
ing along is only permitted in institutional accounts or for large orders. Joe is
not running an institutional account and his order does not meet the large-or-
der threshold, so the firm cannot trade along Joe’s orders.
```
```
4.5.1.2 No Knowledge
A firm that implements effective internal controls, such that the proprietary trad-
ing desk has no knowledge of customer orders, may execute trades for its own
account without triggering a Manning obligation.
```
```
4.5.1.3 Riskless Principal Trades
A proprietary trade executed by a firm that is one leg of a riskless principal trade
is not subject to this rule, provided that the trade is properly reported as a risk-
less principal transaction.
```
```
Knopman Note: If a firm trades for its own account to execute a
customer’s order as a riskless principal trade, this does not trigger
a Manning obligation. This is sometimes referred to as executing a
facilitated order.
```
```
4.5.1.4 Intermarket Sweep Orders (ISOs)
When a customer enters an intermarket sweep order, as earlier discussed, the
customer is effectively consenting to receiving a price that may be inferior to the
other orders a broker-dealer executes to facilitate the ISO. Therefore, a Manning
obligation does not apply—but only if the firm has a supervisory system in place
that can reconstruct time-sequenced order activities.
```
```
4.5.1.5 Odd-Lot and Error Transactions
Trades executed solely to offset a customer’s odd-lot order or to correct a bona
fide error are not subject to the Manning Rule.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
Knopman Note: A broker-dealer can trade ahead of a customer limit
order if the:
```
1. Market maker has a better price than the customer (e.g., customer
    bid is 9.00; market maker bid is 9.01; i.e., market maker is willing to
    pay more), or
2. Trades are for institutional accounts or large orders (trades of 10,000
shares or more and > $100,000), with disclosure, or
3. No-knowledge exception applies (i.e., the firm’s proprietary traders
are not aware of the firm’s customers’ limit orders)

##### 4.5.2 Minimum Price Improvement

Along with prohibiting firms from trading ahead of their customers’ orders, FINRA
Rule 5320 defines the minimum level of price improvement a member must pro-
vide to avoid triggering a violation. **Price improvement** refers to the minimum
incremental difference from a customer’s order at which a broker-dealer can
trade without triggering a Manning obligation.

The price improvement levels are summarized as follows:

```
Order Price Minimum Price Improvement
$1+ (NMS stocks) $0.01
$1+ (OTC equities) Lesser of $0.01 or ½ of inside spread
$0.01–$1 Lesser of $0.01 or ½ of inside spread
$0.001–$0.01 Lesser of $0.001 or ½ of inside spread
$0.0001–$0.001 Lesser of $0.0001 or ½ of inside spread
$0.00001–$0.0001 Lesser of $0.00001 or ½ of inside spread
< $0.00001 Lesser of $0.000001 or ½ of inside spread
```
```
Example
Jim enters an order to buy 5,000 shares of AAPL common stock at $120.35. The
market maker could purchase AAPL at $120.36 or higher, to avoid triggering
a Manning obligation.
```
```
Example
Jane enters an order to buy 500 shares of XYYZZ common stock, an OTC
equity security, when the inside market is 0.00345–0.00485. Half the spread
is $0.0007, which is less than $0.001. Therefore, the market maker must pay
at least $0.00415 (inside bid + $0.0007) for its own account in order to avoid
a Manning obligation.
```

Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

```
Knopman Note: For NMS stocks trading for $1 or more, the minimum
price improvement is one penny. For example, the smallest price
improvement available to a bid of $12.30 is one cent, making the bid
$12.31. A bid of $12.305 is not permissible. The smallest price improvement
available for an offer of $12.35 is $12.34 (down one cent); a quote of $12.345
is not permitted.
```
#### 4.6 Net Transactions with Customers

```
A net transaction , also called a net basis trade , is a principal trade in which
there is virtually no risk to the dealer. The term is defined by FINRA Rule 2124 as
“a transaction in which a market maker, after having received an order to buy an
equity security, purchases the equity security at one price from a broker-dealer or
another customer and then sells to the customer at a different price.” The trade
can also be done in the opposite fashion, where the broker-dealer receives an
order to sell and then sells the stock in the open market at a higher price, then
momentarily buys the shares from the customer.
As an example, an institutional trader might instruct its broker-dealer: “Get me
1,000 shares of ABC Company stock at $57 per share.” The broker-dealer will scour
the market and locate a seller willing to supply 1,000 shares at $57 or less. If the
best price available is $55, the trader can, within seconds, buy them at $55 and
sell those same shares to the customer at $57, earning a quick and almost risk-
less $2 per share. This is considered a net transaction. A net trade is similar to a
riskless principal trade, except that in a net trade the first and second legs of the
transaction are executed at different prices.
Net transactions are not unethical or illegal. However, before executing these
transactions, members must provide appropriate notification to customers. The
approval requirements are different for institutional and retail clients. Members
must retain all documentation relating to consents for three years.
Again, the difference between a riskless principal trade and a net trade is that
both legs of a riskless principal trade are done at the same price, whereas the two
legs of a net trade are at different prices.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
Example
Riskless Principal Trade:
```
1. BD A receives a customer order to buy 100 shares of XYZ.
2. BD A buys 100 shares of XYZ at $50 per share.
3. BD A sells 100 shares of XYZ to the customer at $50 per share plus a
commission.
Note: BD A bought and sold the XYZ shares at the same price ($50) plus a
commission.

```
Net Trade:
```
1. BD N receives a customer order to buy 100 shares of XYZ.
2. BD N buys 100 shares of XYZ at $50 per share.
3. BD N sells 100 shares of XYZ to the customer at $51, net (inclusive of the
mark-up).
Note: BD N bought ($50) the XYZ shares and then sold ($51) them at a higher
price (including a built-in fee).

##### 4.6.1 Institutional Customer Authorization for Net Trades

**Institutional customers** include banks, savings and loans, insurance companies,
registered investment companies, investment advisers, and other customers with
total assets of at least $50 million. Institutional customers must consent to net
transactions prior to their execution. The consent must evidence the customer’s
understanding of the terms and conditions of these types of orders.

For institutional clients, the consent can be obtained in three ways:

```
◆ Negative consent letter —The letter provides all required disclosures
and gives the broker-dealer authority to execute the customer’s orders
on a net basis unless the customer objects. The letter must provide a
meaningful way for the client to object to each transaction, but if no
objection arrives, the member may assume that the standing consent
continues. A copy of the letter must be retained by the member.
◆ Oral order-by-order —A firm may provide an oral disclosure and obtain
an oral consent from the customer on an order-by-order basis. Each
oral communication must clearly explain the terms and conditions for
handling the customer order and provide meaning ful opportunity to
object. The member must document, order by order, the customer’s
understanding of the terms and conditions and consent to the trade.
◆ Written order-by-order —The member firm may choose to make the
same order-by-order disclosures on a written basis.
```

_Chapter 4_
Handling
Customer Orders

##### 4.6.2 Retail Customer Authorization for Net Trades

```
For retail customers, consent must be obtained on a written order-by-order
basis prior transaction execution. Verbal consent is prohibited, as is a negative
consent letter. The customer must evidence understanding of the terms and con-
ditions of each net basis trade.
```
```
Knopman Note: The permission requirements to execute a net
transaction for a client differ for retail investors and institutional
investors. Candidates should know the three ways to get approval from
institutional clients and the one way to get approval from retail clients.
```
##### 4.6.3 Discretionary Account Authorization for Net Trades

```
A discretionary account is an account in which a registered rep has the author-
ity to make investment decisions on behalf of a client. In a discretionary account,
a registered rep does not need the approval of a client prior to each transaction.
Put another way, the broker-dealer need not look through the fiduciary to see
which kind of approval applies.
```
```
Example
An investment advisory firm has discretion to trade a retail account. Since
the adviser is an institution, the member may follow the net trade rules for
disclosure and consent for an institution—negative consent, order-by-order
oral, or order-by-order written.
```

1. To qualify for the intermarket sweep order
    (ISO) exception to the Manning Rule, a firm
    must have in place a supervisory system
       capable of:
          A. reconstructing time-sequenced order
             activities.
          B. receiving FINRA pre-approval for ISO
             orders.
          C. red-flagging ISO orders for FINRA review.
          D. measuring real-time risk in ISO order
             execution.
2. A member is not deemed to have traded
    ahead of a customer limit order if the member
       executes the customer’s order within what
    timeframe?
       A. 15 seconds
       B. 30 seconds
       C. 60 seconds
       D. 90 seconds
3. Nasdaq system hours are:

```
A. 9:30 am to 4:00 pm.
B. 8:00 am to 8:00 pm.
C. 4:00 am to 4:00 pm.
D. 4:00 am to 8:00 pm.
```
4. A customer wishes to enter an order so that
    it will be executed immediately against the
    displayed quote up to its full size. Any portion
    of the order not executed immediately will
    not be routed elsewhere. This order should be
    marked:
       A. FOK.
          B. AON.
          C. IOC.
          D. GTC.
5. A customer places an order to purchase 100
shares of ABC stock at $45, but instructs their
broker that they would actually pay $0.50
higher if needed. To facilitate this, their broker
should place a:
A. collared order.
B. market peg order.
C. discretionary order.
D. not held order.

**Progress Check**

```
Chapter 4: Handling Customer Orders
```

**Progress Check—Solutions**

1. **(A)** The ISO exception is only available when the customer order is received after the
    member has routed the ISO. FINRA requires that the member have supervisory systems
    capable of reconstructing time-sequenced order activity.
2. **(C)** The trade must be executed no later than one minute after the firm trades for its own
    account.
3. **(D)** Nasdaq system hours are 4:00 am to 8:00 pm. This is different than normal market
    hours, which are 9:30 am to 4:00 pm.
4. **(C)** An immediate-or-cancel (IOC) order instruction allows a customer to take the
opposite side of a displayed quote and take up to the full size quoted, knowing that any
remaining portion of the order will be immediately cancelled.
5. **(C)** A discretionary order is a traditional limit order but also includes an undisplayed price
    range that the customer will accept.

#### 4.7 Fair Prices and Commissions

```
FINRA Rule 2121, commonly referred to as the 5% mark-up policy, requires mem-
ber firms to charge customers fair prices and commissions. The rule applies to
principal and agency trades as well as transactions done on a riskless principal
or net basis.
Since the 1940s, FINRA has followed a 5% policy to determine the maximum
amount of mark-up or commission that can be applied to a trade. FINRA pro-
vides the following interpretation of the policy:
◆ The 5% policy should be considered a guide, not a hard-and-fast rule.
◆ A mark-up pattern of less than 5% may be considered unfair or
unreasonable, in some cases.
◆ The determination of fairness must be based on consideration of all
relevant factors, of which the 5% standard is just one.
```
```
Knopman Note: The FINRA 5% policy is a guideline, NOT a rule. There are
cases where a higher than 5% fee may be justified.
```
```
Factors that should be considered in a fair-price policy include:
◆ The type of security involved, and customary fair prices charged across
the industry by type
◆ The availability of the security in the market. Charges should not be as
high for easily accessible securities.
◆ The price of the security. Expressed as a percentage, a mark-up is usually
greater for low-priced securities than for higher-priced ones.
◆ The dollar size of the transaction. Customers should receive some
consideration in pricing large orders.
Securities sold with a prospectus or an offering circular at a public offering price
(e.g., new issues, mutual funds), along with municipal securities, are not subject
to the 5% policy. These types of transactions are subject to different rules, which
are beyond the scope of this examination.
```
```
Knopman Note: The 5% mark-up policy applies to transactions in both
listed and unlisted securities, but does not apply to investment advisory
fees.
```
```
Knopman Note: When a broker-dealer is trading as a principal, it can
consider the fact that it is entitled to a profit when determining a fair
price. When a broker-dealer is trading as agent, it cannot.
```

Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

##### 4.7.1 Calculation of Mark-Ups and Mark-Downs

```
The 5% policy mandates that the mark-up or mark-down charged to a customer
when a firm is trading as principal be reasonably related to the current market
price for the security. Therefore, for liquid stocks, the percentage mark-up or
mark-down will be calculated off the inside market.
```
```
Example
MMAA sells ABC common stock to a client at $6.84 at a time when the inside
market is 6.70–6.71. The best available price to the customer, as indicated
by the best offer, is $6.71. The sale price of $6.84 represents a difference, or
mark-up, of $0.13 or 1.94% (calculated as 0.13/6.71).
```
```
When a broker-dealer is purchasing as a principal, the mark-down is calculated
in the same manner, but using the best bid.
For securities with limited trading, broker-dealers must use reasonable due dil-
igence to determine the current market price for the security, including, but not
limited to, ascertaining quotes from other firms.
```
```
Knopman Note: When determining an equity mark-up or mark-down, a
firm would not consider its own cost (or basis) in the security; instead
the firm should look to the current market price.
The 5% policy is different for debt securities. For debt securities, the
mark-up or mark-down should first reflect the prevailing market price,
which is established by the firm’s contemporaneous cost or proceeds (i.e.,
recent purchase or sale price by that firm).
```
```
4.7.1.1 Proceeds Transaction
The 5% policy also applies to proceeds transactions , whereby a customer
instructs a broker-dealer to liquidate one position and immediately use the pro-
ceeds to open a new position.
When executing a proceeds transaction, the commission or fee to liquidate the
initial leg is added to the fee to open the new position in order to determine the
total percentage mark-up or commission.
```
```
Example
Joe, a customer of XYZ Securities, asks the firm to sell his position in AAPL
and use the money to open a position in GOOG. XYZ sells Joe’s AAPL shares
and buys GOOG for Joe when the best offer on the stock is $980. XYZ charges
Joe a $10 commission to liquidate AAPL and a $15 mark-up to purchase GOOG.
Therefore, the total fee charged on the trade is calculated as: (Total Fees for
Both Transactions)/Best Offer = ($10 + $15)/$980 = 2.55%.
```

#### 4.8 Extended Hours Trading

```
Regular market hours are from 9:30 am–4:00 pm, ET. Extended hours trading
occurs outside regular market hours—both before (pre-market) and after (after-
hours). Extended hours vary among exchanges. On the New York Stock Exchange
and Nasdaq markets, pre-market hours are from 4:00 am–9:30 am, and after-
hours are from 4:00 pm–8:00 pm. In general, retail investors are discouraged
from extended-hours trading, due to the higher risk, greater volatility, and greater
potential for unfavorable trade execution.
Before a customer executes any extended hours transactions, the member firm
must deliver an extended hours trading risk disclosure statement. The disclo-
sure may be delivered either in hardcopy or electronically. If the member allows
online account opening and trading, the disclosure must also be posted on the
member’s website in a clear and conspicuous manner. The disclosure is only
required for customers who wish to trade in extended hours. The extended hours
trading risk disclosure statement must cover six specific types of risk involved.
FINRA has created a model statement that addresses all of these risks. A member
may use the model, or any alternative format, provided that it 1) is substantially
similar to the model statement and 2) addresses, at a minimum, all six risks.
FINRA advises members to consider whether to develop additional disclosures
based on firm- or product-specific needs. These can include specific informa-
tion relating to trading exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options trading, options
exercises, and the effect of stock splits or dividend payments during extended
hours trading.
```
The following sections will discuss the key risks of extended hours trading that
must be disclosed to investors.

```
Knopman Note: Customers wishing to engage in extended hours trading
must receive a risk disclosure document which highlights the following
after-hours trading risk factors: lack of liquidity, high volatility, unlinked
markets, effect of news, and wider spreads.
```
##### 4.8.1 Lower Liquidity

```
Trading volume in extended hours is a small fraction (approximately 2%) of the
trading volume during regular market hours. Lower volume means less liquidity
and wider bid–ask spreads. To fill an entire market order, a firm may need to
execute at two or more different prices.
```
##### 4.8.2 Greater Volatility

```
Volatility is the rate of change in a security’s price. As volatility increases, so does
risk. Increased volatility makes market orders especially risky, because prices can
change quickly and sharply in a short time. In general, market orders should not
be entered during extended hours, especially for thinly traded stocks. While limit
```

Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

```
orders are preferable, because they require a particular price, they may be only
partially executed, or not executed at all, during extended hours.
Stop loss orders also carry significant risk during extended hours because they
activate into market orders. Because of the reduced liquidity, it’s possible for a
stop order to be activated or triggered at one price and then be executed a con-
siderable distance away; i.e., there can be large gaps in extended hours quotes.
```
```
Example
Joe enters an order to “sell 300 shares at 37.45 STOP” when the market is cur-
rently at 38.00−.15. The market subsequently starts moving down until there
is an execution at 37.45. This trade will activate Joe’s order into a market order.
However, due to significant volatility and downward pressure on the stock,
the best bid at the time the order is activated is 37.00. Therefore, Joe’s order
will be executed at 37.00, representing a significant deviation from Joe’s stop
price of 37.45.
```
```
The same gap risk exists during normal market hours, but is more pronounced
during extended hours.
```
##### 4.8.3 Changing Prices

```
During regular market hours, prices reflect the balance between large numbers of
buyers and sellers. As many market makers cease quoting at the regular market
close, extended hours prices may not reflect true market value. Prices can change
drastically right after the close of regular market hours, as after-market trading
begins. This change can be driven by speculation or manipulation, especially if
news is announced.
```
##### 4.8.4 Unlinked Markets

```
At times, the prices displayed on a particular extended hours trading system may
not reflect the prices in other concurrently operating extended hours trading
systems dealing in the same securities—this situation is called an unlinked mar-
ket. An unlinked market may result in transaction executions at inferior prices
than those available on a trading system not visible to the customer or broker.
Although member firms have an obligation to seek best execution, fulfilling this
duty is more difficult in extended hours trading.
```
##### 4.8.5 News Announcements

```
Issuers often make news announcements after regular trading hours. It is com-
mon for companies to release quarterly earnings between 4:00 pm and 6:00 pm. If
reported earnings beat consensus, stock prices can soar by 5%–10% or more. The
opposite pattern is also common when companies report disappointing earnings.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
Government agencies also may announce market-moving data releases before
the market opens. For example, weekly jobless claims are announced by the US
Department of Labor at 8:30 am on Thursdays. Monthly reports on housing starts,
consumer spending, and nonfarm payrolls are also released in pre-market hours.
High-frequency traders (HFTs) use powerful algorithms to trade on breaking
news within fractions of a second of its release. This can increase price volatility.
```
##### 4.8.6 Risk of Wider Spreads

The lower liquidity and higher volatility of extended hours trading often results in
bid–ask spreads that are wider than normal, especially in thinly traded securities.

```
Knopman Note: Investors may face wide spreads (a large difference
between the bid and the ask) if they 1) trade outside of normal market
hours or 2) trade penny stocks (discussed later).
```
#### 4.9 Ethics and Rules Involved in Customer Orders

```
Securities professionals have an obligation to “observe high standards of com-
mercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade,” but what does that
mean exactly? Regulators shed light on this by writing rules and giving guid-
ance to help firms navigate their responsibilities. This section will review what
is required and prohibited for FINRA member firms.
```
##### 4.9.1 Best Execution

One mandate of broker-dealers is to obtain best execution for their customers.
A FINRA member must use reasonable due diligence to ensure **best execution**.
This means:

```
◆ Determining the best market for each customer order
◆ Making every effort to execute a market order fully and promptly, and
◆ Executing orders at prices as favorable as possible for the customer
under prevailing market conditions
```
The factors that determine best execution include:

```
◆ The character of the market for the security, including price, volatility,
relative liquidity, and available communications
◆ The size and type of transaction
◆ Quote accessibility
◆ Order terms and conditions, as communicated by the customer
Market makers should consider a variety of trading venues to determine where
best execution is available. The best market requires firms to do more than sim-
ply ascertain a quote from a single exchange. This concept has helped to promote
the development and growth of new types of electronic markets.
```

Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

```
Quote accessibility is an important factor in determining reasonable due dili-
gence. For example, quote access can often be limited for thinly traded stocks.
Nonetheless, the best-execution obligation rule still applies.
The best-execution responsibility applies to all orders—exchange-traded and
OTC, domestic and foreign. If an order is for a security on which limited price
information or quotes are available, it is the member’s responsibility to have
appropriate policies and procedures in place. FINRA previously had a rule requir-
ing broker-dealers to actually contact at least three market makers to ascertain
quotes for illiquid securities. While the so-called Three-Quote Rule no longer
exists, firms should nonetheless contact a reasonable number of other bro-
ker-dealers to ensure they have satisfied their best-execution obligation for the
security.
The firm should document methods for determining the best market. FINRA has
indicated that members generally should seek out several sources of pricing infor-
mation or potential liquidity when filling customer orders. Policies and procedures
should cover the handling of orders for foreign securities, so as to obtain the best
execution when taking into account currency exchange rates and market structures.
```
```
Knopman Note: To summarize best execution, when a MM considers
where to route customer orders, it should consider:
```
1. The character of the market for the security
    2. The size and type of transaction
    3. The number of markets checked, and
4. Accessibility of the quotation

```
The number of shares executed in a particular market is not a factor
FINRA includes in the best-execution requirement.
```
```
4.9.1.1 Directed Orders
Best execution is not required in one case—when the member receives a custom-
e r ’s unsolicited order with instructions to route the order to a particular market
for execution. In this case, the firm should follow the customer’s instructions and
must mark the order ticket as a directed order. Any broker-dealer to which such
an order is routed must ensure best execution. This is the only case in which a
member’s best execution responsibility is transferrable to another broker-dealer.
Unsolicited orders are still subject to the rule when the customer does not direct
the order to be routed to a specific market.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
4.9.1.2 Review of Execution Quality
Any member that regularly routes customer orders to another broker-dealer on
an automated, non-discretionary basis must have procedures for conducting
regular and rigorous reviews of the overall quality of trade execution if it does not
conduct an order-by-order review. Here are guidelines for these reviews:
◆ They must be conducted on a security-by-security basis and by type of
order (e.g., market, limit, etc.).
◆ They must be conducted quarterly, at a minimum.
◆ Members must determine whether material differences in execution
quality exist among markets. If so, routing arrangements must be
modified or justified.
◆ The member must compare the quality of executions from available
competing markets, considering such factors as price improvement
opportunities, the likelihood of limit order executions, the speed and size
of executions, transaction costs, customer needs and expectations, and
the existence of payment for order flow.
```
##### 4.9.2 Prohibited Activities

FINRA Rules 2020 and 6140 , and Nasdaq Rule 2120, provide that no member
“shall effect any transaction in, or induce the purchase or sale of, any security by
means of any manipulative, deceptive or other fraudulent device or contrivance.”
Basically, the rules prohibit all manipulative or deceptive means to sell securities.
Market manipulations can take many forms, including:
◆ False rumors that are circulated with the intent to influence prices in
ways that will generate profits for the rumor-spreaders
◆ Traders who act together to manipulate prices, often by creating an
artificial appearance of supply or demand (sometimes called a **stock
pool** or **painting the tape** )

```
Knopman Note: Painting the tape can inflate trading volume, manipulate
the stock price, or both.
```
```
◆ Pump and dump schemes , in which promoters use false or misleading
statements to inflate stock prices before shares are dumped on the
public at a profit for promoters
◆ Spoofing quotes , in which a trader briefly displays a quote to
manipulate prices to be higher or lower, with no intent to actually
execute at the quoted price. In other words, spoofing refers to entering
orders to entice other participants to join on the same side of the market,
and then trading against the other market participants’ orders.
```

Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

```
◆ Pre-arranged matched trades , in which a trader inflates trading
volume by executing (or arranging) both sides of a trade. This practice is
common amongst penny stock promoters who want the public to believe
active interest in a stock exists, when in fact little or none does.
```
```
Knopman Note: Here are a few other types of market manipulation:
```
- **Collusion** is a manipulative and prohibited practice where
    traders coordinate prices or the bid–ask spread. This goes well
    beyond negotiating trade prices (which is allowed). Note that an
    underwriting syndicate is allowed to act together to support a new
    issue by having one firm, on behalf of all the broker-dealers in the
    syndicate, place a stabilizing bid (discussed later).
- Another type of manipulation is **layering**. Layering refers to entering
    limit orders with the intended effect of moving the market to obtain
    a beneficial execution on the other side of the market.
- **Quote stuffing** is a prohibited practice where algorithmic traders
    enter and then quickly withdraw large orders for the purpose of
    creating confusion in the market and taking advantage of trading
    opportunities.

```
The following sections discuss more of these prohibited activities.
```
```
4.9.2.1 Complex Products
If the value of a security is derived from another asset (a derivative security ) or is
contingent on the occurrence of an event (a contingency security ), the security
is considered complex. Securities professionals should determine suitability and
the customer’s financial sophistication when recommending such investments
and consider alternative, less-complicated investments that could also meet the
customer’s goals.
To make the suitability determination for complex products, firms must have
adequate supervisory and compliance programs in place before registered rep-
resentatives recommend them to clients. This includes training agents about
complex products and deploying technology to identify and monitor market risk.
```
```
4.9.2.2 Interpositioning
Interpositioning means adding an additional broker-dealer between the mem-
ber and the best market for a security so that the customer does not receive best
execution. The prohibition on interpositioning applies to both principal and
agency trades and all types of securities for both retail and institutional customers.
For example, an interpositioning violation occurs if a member routes a trade
through another broker-dealer to receive soft dollars or payment for order flow
and the client receives the same or a less favorable trade price.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
If a member must use a second broker-dealer to ensure best execution on a trade,
the due diligence responsibility for best execution remains with the original firm.
However, if a second broker-dealer knowingly participates in interpositioning,
the original firm may also be held in violation.
When a non-market-making firm executes an OTC trade on behalf of a customer,
it should work through a market maker to ensure best execution. However,
FINRA has indicated that when a market maker originates a trade, placing a
broker-dealer between the customer and market maker is generally considered
interpositioning and is prohibited.
```
The only exception to interpositioning is if the customer receives a more favor-
able price as a result of adding a second firm to the execution chain.

```
Knopman Note: If introducing the additional party results in a superior
price (not equal, but better), then doing so is allowed.
```
```
4.9.2.3 Front-Running
Front-running is the illegal practice of a broker-dealer trading equity securities
when the firm or person entering the order is in possession of nonpublic infor-
mation concerning an imminent block transaction in the security. Market partic-
ipants front-run to take advantage of the market-making information inherent
in the pending large order. Regulations regarding front-running are set forth in
FINRA Rule 5270. A block transaction under this rule is generally defined as an
order of 10,000 shares or more.
```
```
Example
California Pension Fund enters an order with a broker-dealer to buy 50,000
shares of ABC common stock. The trader who received the order quickly buys
3,000 shares for the firm’s own account in anticipation of the value of ABC
increasing upon placing the block order. This is a violation.
```
The prohibition on front-running also applies to trading-related derivatives, such
as options and security futures, in advance of a known imminent block trade in
either the derivative or the underlying.

```
Example
California Pension Fund enters an order to buy 500 call options on ABC com-
mon stock. The trader who received the order quickly buys 3,000 shares for
the firm’s own account in anticipation of the value of ABC increasing. This
is a violation.
```
```
Once knowledge of the block transaction has been made publicly available due
to execution and reporting of the trade, the front-running restrictions no longer
apply.
```

Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

```
Knopman Note: Even if part of a block transaction has already been
executed, the entire order must be filled and publicly reported to avoid
triggering a front-running violation.
```
```
The rules also provide a few exemptions from the front-running policy, including:
◆ Transactions where the member has information barriers to prevent the
internal disclosure of block transactions
```
```
Example
California Pension Fund enters an order with a broker-dealer to buy 50,000
shares of ABC common stock. A trader in a different department of the firm,
who has no knowledge of the fund’s order, due to information barriers, subse-
quently buys 3,000 shares for the firm’s own account. This is not a front-run-
ning violation.
```
```
◆ Transactions related to a prior customer order in the security
◆ Transactions to correct errors
◆ Transactions to offset odd lots (less than 100 shares)
◆ Transactions in compliance with the marketplace rules of a national
securities exchange
```
```
Knopman Note: Make sure to review the exemptions from the front-
running rules detailed above.
```
```
Although the rule specifically relates to front-running block orders, front-run-
ning other types of orders whereby the firm places its own financial interests
ahead of a customer’s may be a violation of other FINRA rules and regulations.
```
```
Knopman Note: If a firm is holding a customer’s block order to buy shares,
it could execute another customer’s order in the security without being
in violation of the front-running rule.
```
```
4.9.2.4 Market Manipulation and Rumors
FINRA prohibits the spreading of false or misleading rumors. Members may not
make statements or circulate any information concerning any security if the
member knows or has reasonable grounds to believe the information:
◆ Is false or misleading, or
◆ Would improperly influence the security’s market price
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
Knopman Note: Tweeting newsworthy information as a means of public
dissemination is not a violation as long as the information is accurate.
However, if a CEO tweets newsworthy information about a company that
is not factually accurate and which causes the stock to rise, this would
be considered manipulative and deceptive. For example, if a CEO of a
company tweets that they have secured funding to take the company
private without knowledge of the company’s board of directors, it would
be considered market manipulation.
```
The manner of transmission is not important—rumors cannot be spread via any
media, including personal contact, correspondence, emails, chat rooms, blogs,
and websites. Indeed, even responding to or passing along rumors can be deemed
prohibited behavior.

```
Example
Trader 1 : Did you hear the one about Micromatix being acquired by Argent?
Trader 2 : I don’t believe that’s true. But I won’t say a word, if you want to
play it.
Trader 1 : Could you pump it a little on your end?
Trader 2 : I’ll see what I can do.
Trader 1 is pumping a penny stock with a false rumor of an acquisition. But
is Trader 2 involved in spreading the rumor? The answer is yes, if the trader
discusses a rumor he believes to be false.
```
```
It’s important to note that the FINRA rule is not limited to spreading false
rumors. It also prohibits creating or inducing a false or misleading appearance
of activity in a security, or the market for it. In the example above, if Trader 2
now engages in trading Micromatix stock, regulators could conclude the purpose
was to create an appearance of activity. The prohibited methods for creating a
false appearance include:
◆ Executing transactions that involve no change in beneficial ownership
◆ Entering orders with knowledge that offsetting orders will be made by
others
```
```
4.9.2.5 Securities Pools
```
A **pool** is a manipulative scheme involving two or more participants, in which
trading is for the purpose of unfairly influencing the market price. Members are
prohibited from engaging in, financing (e.g., through margin accounts), or solic-
iting discretionary orders for manipulative operations.
When member firms suspect that customers are entering orders for a manipu-
lative pool, they should not extend margin. By financing a pool, the member or
trader may be considered part of the manipulative scheme.

4.9.2.6 Undisclosed Joint Accounts
Under FINRA Rule 6140, members (firms) and employees may not hold interest
in a joint trading account unless the account is reported to FINRA. The report
must include:
```
1. Names of all joint account participants and their ownership percentages
2. The purpose of the account
3. Identity of the member carrying and clearing the account
4. Any written agreement authorizing the account
This provision covers both formal and informal—written or verbal—arrange-
ments to share profits and losses from trading.

```
4.9.2.7 Marking the Open and Marking the Close
The opening and closing prices of a security each trading day have special impor-
tance because these are widely disseminated and used to benchmark market
performance and mark-to-mark brokerage accounts. Unscrupulous firms may be
tempted to manipulate the opening or closing prices of a security for this reason.
This prohibited practice is known as marking the open or marking the close.
A common way to mark the close is to sell a small number of shares at a cheap
price just prior to the end of trading to drive down the price. Subsequently, the
trader purchases a larger block at that lower price.
Another way to manipulate the closing price is to place large orders into the mar-
ket just prior to 4:00 pm and then cancel those orders before they are executed.
This can create the appearance that there is substantial interest in trading the
security, even if none exists.
```
```
Knopman Note: A marking-the-close violation occurs if trades are placed
with the intent to artificially affect the closing price.
```
##### 4.9.3 Prohibited Transactions by Investment Advisers

```
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (IA Act) defines the role and responsibilities
of an investment adviser. An investment adviser is defined as “an individual or
entity (firm) that, for financial gain, engages in the business of advising others,
either directly or through publications or writings, on the value of securities or
advises on investing, purchasing, or selling securities, or that, for compensation
and as part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports on
securities.”
According to Section 206, it is unlawful for any investment adviser to:
◆ Employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or
prospective client
◆ Engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business that operates
as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client, and
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
◆ Act as principal for his own account without disclosing to his client in
writing before the completion of the transaction
```
These prohibitions shall not apply to any transaction with a customer of a bro-
ker-dealer if the firm is not acting as an investment adviser in relation to such a
transaction. For example, a firm provides both advice and brokerage securities
to a client, but the client decides to place an unsolicited brokerage order without
advice. In this case, these advisory rules do not apply.
Within the IA Act of 1940, certain specific business practices and behaviors are
regulated. These include:
◆ **General disclosures** —An IA should disclose to its clients any fact that
would have a material impact on that client’s ability to judge, select, and
hire the IA. Examples of required disclosures include:

- Fees received for placing clients into specific funds or investments
- Fees paid to solicitors for bringing in clients, and
- Disciplinary actions by any regulator or governing agency
◆ **Disclosure of performance or selected recommendations** —If an
IA wants to publish the firm’s past recommendations or performance
statistics, the disclosures must be comprehensive. Comprehensive
recommendations include all recommendations or investments over the
past 12 months. Selectively disclosing only winning recommendations,
or a partial list of recommendations, is deceptive and prohibited. If
performance (e.g., up 14% this year) is disclosed, the rate of return must
be displayed net of fees (i.e., inclusive of fees) or the IA must prominently
display returns both net and gross of fees.
◆ **Te st i m o n i a l s** —A testimonial is defined as a statement made by a client
or investor made about their experience with the IA. Testimonials are
heavily regulated and can only be used by an IA if it discloses 1) who gave
the testimonial, 2) whether any cash or non-cash compensation was
provided for the testimonial, and 3) any material conflicts of interest
between the promoter and the IA.
◆ **IA agency and principal transactions** —If an IA acts as an agent or a
principal in a transaction with a client, the IA must receive written client
consent prior to the transaction.
- An **agency trade** occurs if the IA arranges a trade between two of its
advisory clients.
- A **principal trade** occurs if the IA is the customer’s counterparty,
buying securities from the customer for its own account or selling its
own securities to the customer.
IAs typically route traders through a broker-dealer, in which case these consents
do not apply.

Knopman Note: Like broker-dealers, investment advisers are required to
register with the SEC or with the states where they operate. An exception
is available for certain professionals (e.g., accountants, lawyers, etc.) who
render incidental investment advice. That is, if the advice is incidental to
the accounting or legal advice being rendered, the professional need not
register as an investment adviser.
```
#### 4.10 Uniform Practice Code (UPC) Rules

```
FINRA’s Uniform Practice Code (UPC) is a body of rules and interpretations
aiming to create uniform business practices within the broker-dealer commu-
nity, especially in operations and trade settlement. The UPC is administered by
FINRA’s Uniform Practice Committee. Part of the committee’s responsibility is to
advise the FINRA Regulation Board on the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions.
All OTC transactions in securities by members are subject to the UPC except:
◆ Exempt bank holding company securities
◆ Municipal securities
◆ Transactions between members that are cleared and settled through a
registered clearing agent
◆ Transactions in securities issued by registered investment companies
◆ Transactions in direct participation programs (e.g., limited partnerships)
```
##### 4.10.1 Settlement Process

```
Settlement is the process of transferring securities and cash between the buyer
and seller of an agreed-upon transaction. Settlement of most equity trades is
facilitated by the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), a subsidiary
of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC).
```
```
Knopman Note: Securities, such as stocks and bonds, are typically
deposited with a clearing house.
```
```
4.10.1.1 Continuous Net Settlement
To facilitate the clearing and settlement of tens of millions of trades per day
between thousands of broker-dealers, NSCC/DTCC has developed the continu-
ous net settlement (CNS) system, a netting and fail-control engine. The service
is available to all full-service settling members of NSCC/DTCC.
Regardless of a dealer’s trading volume, CNS nets each firm’s securities obliga-
tions on a daily basis to one net-long and one net-short position in each issue.
NSCC then becomes the counterparty to each trade, ensuring that each transac-
tion is guaranteed on both sides. Any closing fail positions are marked to market
daily and re-netted with new transactions, which also reduces risk.
```

```

Customer Orders
```
```
Example
On Tuesday, the clients of ABC Brokerage, Inc., engage in the following trades
for Disney common stock (DIS).
```
```
Transaction Time Transaction Type Transaction Amount
9:45 am Buy 600 shares
10:30 am Sell 2,000 shares
11:20 am Sell 800 shares
12:45 pm Buy 1,800 shares
3:00 pm Sell 900 shares
Total 1,300 shares
```
```
Overall, ABC clients were a net seller of 1,300 shares of DIS stock. Therefore,
NSCC will require ABC to deliver 1,300 shares of stock, rather than requiring
receipt and delivery for each of the five individual transactions. ABC will then
allocate the adjusted DIS position among its clients internally.
```
The CNS system minimizes the need to deliver securities to each firm on a posi-
tion-to-position or trade-by-trade basis. Cash dividends, stock dividends, bond
interest, and mandatory corporate actions are automatically calculated and
credited to participants through their CNS accounts.
Members and trade reporting facility participants must clear and settle transac-
tions through a registered clearing agent that uses a continuous net settlement
system.

```
4.10.1.2 Ex-Clearing Settlement
Securities transactions may only be settled ex-clearing if both parties agree
to the transaction. To document any manual comparison, the following trade
details must be included:
◆ Trade and settlement dates
◆ Securities and quantities traded
◆ Transaction price
◆ Accrued interest for fixed-income instruments
◆ Net or settlement dollar amount
```
```
Knopman Note: Ex-clearing describes a trade directly between two
parties with a manual trade comparison process that does not engage
electronic central clearinghouse services, such as those offered by NSCC/
DTCC.
```

Chapter 4

```
4.10.1.3 Settlement Cycle
Securities trades settle when the buyer delivers cash and the seller delivers the
securities. In times past, physical stock certificates were delivered. Now, the
transfer agent officially changes its ownership records, or, for shares held in
street name , the brokerage firm changes its ownership records.
The SEC sets the regular way trade cycle for most equity trades, with settlement
on the second business day after trade execution. For example, a trade on Monday
would settle on Wednesday. The convention applies to most securities—includ-
ing equities, mutual funds, ETFs, and corporate and municipal bonds.
```
```
Knopman Note: Regular way settlement is T + 2.
```
```
To describe a settlement timeframe, the industry uses “T + #” where “T” indicates
the trade date and “#” indicates the number of days after the trade date. Thus, an
equity trade settling regular way is described as T + 2 settlement.
The rule specifically exempts some securities, agreements, and contracts:
◆ Securities —T + 2 does not apply to government securities (T + 1) or
stock option contracts (T + 1).
◆ Agreements —T + 2 does not apply if both counterparties agree to a
different settlement timeframe at the time of the transaction.
◆ Contracts —T + 2 does not apply to alternate settlement date contracts
for :
```
- Securities that the SEC may exempt by order
- Cash sales after 4:30 pm on a new issue pricing date, when both
    parties to the transaction agree to a settlement date extension at the
    time of the transaction

```
4.10.1.4 Dates of Delivery
The table below shows various delivery methods and the accompanying settle-
ment date under FINRA Rule 11320.
```
```
Delivery Method Settlement Date
Cash (same day) On the day of the transaction
Regular way On the second business day following the trade (T + 2)
Seller’s option On any business day after T + 2 with notice at least one day prior to delivery
```
```
Buyer’s option On a date of the buyer’s choice, no later than the expiration of the buyer’s option to receive delivery
Contract due on holiday,
Saturday, or Sunday On the next business day
Delayed delivery On the date agreed, at the time of the trade
Prior to delivery date Early acceptance or rejection is at the election of the purchaser

##### 4.10.2 When-, As-, and If-Issued Contracts (WI)

```
Newly issued securities often trade on a when-, as-, and if-issued basis—short-
ened to when-issued or WI. This means:
◆ For equities —The IPO offering date and price have not yet been
finalized.
◆ For debt —The offering date and coupon rate have not yet been finalized.
When-issued securities are most common for new issues where the securities
do not yet trade. Securities trade WI until the offering date. If enough interest
exists for the new issue, the offering is finalized and the WI settlement date is set.
In addition to new-issue equities, US Treasuries and stock splits often trade WI.
FINRA’s Uniform Practice Code rules require trade confirmations in such secu-
rities to be marked WI. The confirmation must also include:
◆ A description of the security and plan under which it will be issued or
distributed
◆ A designation that FINRA will rule on contract performance, and
◆ A provision for marking the contract to the market
For purposes of valuing WI securities, FINRA requires that they be marked to
the market. If the WI period is lengthy, a member may require the customer to
deposit cash or collateral to secure the contract through the settlement date. Any
deposit must be segregated on the member’s books and may not be used for any
purpose except to secure these contracts.
```
The settlement date for WI securities is determined by the UPC Committee at a
time when a sufficient percentage of the issue is accounted for by outstanding
commitments or orders. Delivery is made on the business day after the seller has
submitted written notice of an intent to deliver securities.
Open market WI contracts publicly offered through a syndicate or selling group,
such as an IPO, are settled the day the syndicate’s contracts are settled.

The UPC Committee may cancel or terminate WI contracts:

```
◆ If securities are not issued
◆ If it is necessary to resolve settlement conflicts
◆ If there are material changes in the redemption schedule, dividend
payments, interest rates, maturities, yields, or exercise price
```
```
Knopman Note: When a re-organized company emerges from
bankruptcy with an IPO, the newly issued shares will generally trade
when-issued with a “v” symbol at the end of the ticker. Once the shares
are formally issued, the “v” symbol is removed.
```

##### 4.10.3 Ex-Dividend, Ex-Rights, and Ex-Warrants

```
For companies issuing warrants or rights or paying dividends, the timing of a
trade will determine whether the buyer or seller receives the additional securi-
ties or dividends. The first day a security trades when the buyer will not receive
dividends, rights, or warrants is called the ex-date.
◆ Ex-dividend —Settlement will occur after the dividend record date, so
the dividend will be paid to the seller rather than the buyer.
◆ Ex-rights —Settlement will occur after the rights record date, so rights
will be issued to the seller.
◆ Ex-warrants —Settlement will occur after the warrants record date, so
warrants will be issued to the seller.
In general, these settlement procedures ensure that the rightful party to the trade
(i.e., buyer or seller) receives the dividend, right, or warrant. Investors buying and
selling on or around the ex-date must be familiar with and understand these
dates as well as which party will receive the distribution.
```
```
Knopman Note: Warrants are similar to call options in that they allow
investors to purchase stock for a specific price. They are usually issued
with another security, such as a bond or preferred stock. It is important
to note that warrants do not pay dividends.
```
##### 4.10.4 Dates Relating to Dividends

```
The declaration date (i.e., announcement date) is the date on which the board
of directors declares a dividend. At this time, the board also specifies two other
important dates: the record date and the payable date. The record date is
the date upon which a stockholder must be a registered owner of the stock—a
holder of record —to receive the dividend. The payable date is the date pay-
ment is actually made—generally about three weeks after the record date.
Another important date in the dividend payment process is the ex-dividend
date. The ex-dividend date governs who, upon the execution of a stock trade,
will receive a dividend. The determination of this date is based on the practice
of settlement , which, again, is when the buyer and seller must both complete a
stock trade. Most equity trades settle regular way (T + 2). The ex-dividend date
is also impacted by the size of the dividend.
```
```
Knopman Note: It is important to note that the record date is the date
that determines which shareholders will receive the dividend.
```

```

```
4.10.4.1 Dividends Worth Less Than 25%
For cash or stock dividends worth less than 25% of the value of the subject secu-
rity, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date. Most cash
dividends are for less than 25% of the value of the subject security.
```
The ex-dividend date is the first day upon which a buyer can purchase stock with-
out receiving the dividend. Because it takes two business days to settle a trade,
the ex-dividend date is one business day prior to the record date. If a trade occurs
before the ex-dividend date, the buyer receives the dividend because the trade
will settle by the record date, and the buyer will be the holder of record. However,
if the trade takes place on or after the ex-dividend date, the seller receives the
dividend because settlement will take place after the record date, and the seller
will still be the holder of record. Below, see how a trade executed on the ex-divi-
dend date does not settle on or before the record date.

The price of the stock drops by the amount of the dividend as of the ex-dividend
date. This happens because a buyer will no longer receive the dividend upon
purchasing the shares, and is therefore unwilling to pay for it.

```
Example
Regular way trade settlement is T + 2. If a stock is bought on Tuesday, it
settles on Thursday. If the record date is Thursday, it will go ex-dividend on
Wednesday. Therefore, an individual buying the stock on Tuesday will receive
the dividend. However, an individual buying the stock on Wednesday will not.
```
The recipient of the dividend is summarized here:

```
Date of Transaction Recipient of Dividend
Before ex-dividend date Buyer
On or after ex-dividend date Seller
```

_Chapter 4_
Handling
Customer Orders

```
4.10.4.2 Dividends Worth 25% or More
For cash or stock dividends worth 25% or more of the value of the subject security,
the ex-dividend date is the first business day following the payable date. Many
forward splits are worth 25% or more of the subject security. The most common
example of this is a 2-for-1 split, which can be thought of as a 100% stock divi-
dend. In this case, those investors who purchase the stock prior to the actual split
(i.e., payable date) are buying pre-split shares. The next day, the stock will trade
ex-dividend, which can be thought of as post-split shares.
```
```
4.10.4.3 Other Ex-Dividend Rules
For stock dividends or splits relating to American depositary receipts (ADRs) and
foreign securities, the ex-date is designated by the UPC Committee. If definitive
information is not received far enough in advance of the record date to permit
designation of an ex-dividend or ex-warrants date, the UPC Committee will des-
ignate the first business day that is practical in light of the circumstances.
```
#### 4.11 Adjustment of Orders

```
FINRA Rule 5330 requires members to adjust open customer orders for corporate
events that affect the security’s price and/or number of shares, including:
◆ Cash dividends
◆ Stock splits and stock dividends
◆ Special situations
For this purpose, open orders include limit orders, stop orders, and stop limit
orders. The adjustment in order terms must be made before the market opens
on the day the security will be first quoted ex-dividend, ex-rights, or ex-warrants.
Adjusted open orders will retain existing time priority over new orders entered.
In all examples of these adjustments below, assume the customer has entered a
limit order to buy 100 shares of ABC stock at $30 per share and the order remains
open, but not executed, because the price has not yet dropped to $30.
```
##### 4.11.1 Cash Dividends

```
Prior to the open of trading on the ex-dividend date, all open orders below the
current market price are automatically reduced by the amount of the dividend.
Orders below the market are buy limit, sell stop, and sell stop limit. As discussed
previously, the ex-dividend date is usually one business day before the record date.
```
```
Knopman Note: For cash dividends, orders entered at or below the
market are reduced on the ex-dividend date—this includes buy limit, sell
stop, and sell stop limit orders.
```
```
If the cash dividend includes fractions of a cent, the adjusted share price is
rounded down to the nearest whole cent. There is no adjustment for cash divi-
dends of less than one whole cent per share.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
```
Example
ABC stock has declared a 25-cent-per-share dividend payable to holders of
record on Friday. Therefore, the ex-dividend date is Thursday. At the close of
trading on Wednesday, the books will be closed for purposes of paying this
dividend, and the stock will then trade ex-dividend. A buy limit order for 100
shares at $30 will automatically be reduced to a limit price of $29.75. Orders
above the market, such as sell limit orders, would not be adjusted.
```
```
Note: If the dividend paid was $0.253 per share (25.3 cents per share), the open
orders would be adjusted down to $29.747 and then rounded down to $29.74.
```
```
Knopman Note: Dividends for fractional cents are rounded up to the
nearest whole cent and then the price is adjusted downwards by that
amount.
```
```
Customers may enter a do not reduce (DNR) instruction if they do not want
their orders automatically reduced. With a DNR attached, the limit order would
remain at $30 at the close of trading on Wednesday. DNR instructions only apply
to cash dividends, not stock dividends or rights.
```
##### 4.11.2 Stock Splits and Dividends

A **stock split** is an adjustment in an issuer’s outstanding share count. After a
stock split, each investor’s ownership position remains unchanged. Rather, the
number of outstanding shares and the value per share are adjusted.

A stock split in which the shareholder receives additional shares is called a **for-
ward split**. A split in which the shareholder’s share count is reduced is called a
**reverse split**. The adjustment rules described below apply only to forward splits.
All open orders must be cancelled prior to reverse splits, as described in the spe-
cial situations section below.
Technically, a forward stock split and a stock dividend are the same type of event.
The shareholder receives additional shares, with each share proportionately
worth a lesser price. The total value of shares remains about the same.

```
Example
ABC stock splits 2-for-1. Instead of holding 100 shares at $30, the investor has
200 shares at $15. The total value of the position remains $3,000 (200 × $15).
```
```
Example
ABC declares a 20% stock dividend, meaning that an investor will receive one
new share for every five shares held. Instead of holding 100 shares at $30, the
investor now has 120 shares at $25. The total value of the position remains
$3,000 (120 × $25).
```
At the close of trading on the day before the ex-dividend or ex-distribution date,
orders below the market must be adjusted.


Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders

```
The formula for adjusting shares is to:
```
1. Determine the ratio of post-split shares to pre-split shares.
2. Multiply the size of the original order by the numerator of the ratio.
3. Divide the results by the denominator of the ratio.

```
Example
As in the previous section, this example is using an order to buy 100 shares
at $30.
```
```
A 20% stock dividend means that an investor receives one new share for every
five shares she owns. So, the ratio is six new shares divided by five old shares:
6/5. A 100-share order would be adjusted as follows:
```
1. Multiply the original size of the order by the numerator: 100 × 6 = 600,
    then
2. Divide by the denominator: 600/5 = 120 Shares
If this calculation produces a fraction, the order is adjusted down to the next
lowest whole number of shares.

```
The price can be adjusted by dividing the original order price by the numerator
of the ratio and multiplying it by the denominator:
```
1. $30/6 = 5
2. 5 × 5 = $25
Therefore, an order to buy 100 shares at $30 becomes an order to buy 120
shares at $25, after a 20% stock dividend. Notice how the $3,000 total value
of the order is unchanged:
◆ Before the adjustment: 100 Shares × $30 = $3,000
◆ After the adjustment: 120 Shares × $25 = $3,000

```
Knopman Note: Expect to see a few questions on the exam on adjusting
stock splits and stock dividends.
```
##### 4.11.3 Special Situations

```
For corporate actions other than cash dividends and forward splits, the adjust-
ment rules vary as follows:
◆ Dividends payable in either cash or securities at the shareholder’s
option —The open buy order price must be reduced by the value of the
cash or securities, whichever is greater.
◆ Dividends payable in both cash and securities —The open buy order
must be adjusted by the sum of the separate parts (cash and securities)
in a two-step calculation. First, the price is adjusted downward by the
cash amount of the dividend. Then, the order is adjusted for the split
value.
```

```
Chapter 4
Handling
Customer Orders
```
◆ **Indeterminate value** —If the value of a stock dividend cannot be
determined, the order must be reconfirmed with the customer before it
can be executed.

◆ **Reverse split** —A reverse split is deployed by issuers to avoid falling
below exchange minimum listing requirements. It increases the price of
the stock and converts each position into proportionately fewer shares.
All open orders are cancelled anytime there is a reverse split.

```
Knopman Note: After a reverse stock split, all open orders are cancelled.

**Unit Exam—Solutions**

1. **(D)** On the morning of the ex-dividend date, open orders at or below the market, including
    buy limit, sell stop, and sell stop limit orders, are all adjusted downwards by the amount
    of the dividend. Any dividends for fractional cents are rounded up to the nearest whole
    cent and then the price is adjusted downwards by that amount. However, because this
    is a sell limit order, which is entered at or above the market, the order will not be
    adjusted.
2. **(A)** When determining an equity mark-up, a firm would not consider its own cost in the
    security; instead, it is calculated based on the inside market (in this case best offer since
    the firm is selling the shares). Therefore, the mark-up is $0.18 (the difference between
    the sale price of $18.00 and best offer of $17.82).
3. **(C)** Interpositioning means adding an additional broker-dealer between the member and
    the best market for a security so that the customer does not receive best execution.
    This is usually done to generate extra mark-ups or commissions and is violation unless
    the customer receives a more favorable price as a result.
4. **(B)** A marketable limit order is a buy limit order with a price at or above the lowest offer
(NBBO offer) or a sell order with a price at or below the highest bid (NBBO bid). It
should be executed immediately, at least in part.
5. **(A)** The Order Protection Rule creates an exception for a quote that changes too fast for
    trading centers to effectively monitor. This is known as the one-second exception.
6. **(A)** The CUSIP number is not required on an order ticket.
7. **(C)** The number of shares executed in a particular market is not a best-execution
    requirement under FINRA rules.
8. **(C)** For retail customers, consent must be obtained in writing from the customer prior to
    trade execution. Note that for retail customers, both verbal consent and negative
    consent letters are prohibited means of approval for net trades.
9. **(B)** Unless an exception exists, market makers must update their quotes to reflect customer
    orders within 30 seconds of order receipt.
10. **(D)** An exception to the Limit Order Display Rule exists if the customer’s size represents a
    de minimis change in the market maker’s size, defined as no more than 10% (not 20%)
    of the market maker’s size. The other choices are all exceptions to the rule.

**Active Learning Strategies Help Information**

**Stick**

```
Active learning helps you engage with the material in a way that promotes retention. Here are
a few of the techniques we recommend in our Study Essentials course to improve the effective-
ness of your study process:
◆ Schedule study blocks to work for 50 minutes and then take a 10-minute break.
Research shows that study sessions are more productive if you allow yourself to take
planned breaks. If 50 minutes is too long, try working for 25 minutes with a 5-minute
break.
◆ Beat the “forgetting curve,” which kicks in when you stay away from material you just
learned, rather than reinforce it. Learned information slips out of our memories over
time if we don’t take action to keep it there. The steepest drop in memory happens
quickly after learning something new, so it’s important to revisit the information you’ve
learned the next day rather than skip a few days.
◆ Remember to use rhymes, acronyms, and mnemonics to make it easier to retain
important information.

6) What defense can a broker-dealer, which has the appropriate
   procedures in place, offer against the allegation that it has engaged in
   self-trading?
    A) The self-trading was not profitable for the firm.
    B) The self-trading did not inflict direct harm on any customer.
    C) The self-trading was unintentional.
    D) The self-trading involved a proprietary account, not a customer
   account.
   Answer Explanation:
   Self-trades occur when both sides of a trade originate with the same firm.
   Broker-dealers must have procedures in place to review and prevent a
   pattern of self-trades. Assuming supervisory procedures are in place, self-
   trades are not violations when they are unintentional i.e., there was no
   intent to create an illusion of trading activity or price. Note that this concept
   is not explicitly covered in the 2nd Edition textbook, but is covered in the
   Class Summary and as long as you review the rationale you will be
   prepared for this item.

12) A market maker is currently quoting $35.60 - $35.80 20 x 34 and is
    holding, but not displaying the following customer limit: Buy 50
    shares at $35.60 and Buy 120 shares at $35.60. Which of the
    following is the smallest customer limit order that would require the
    market maker to update its displayed quote?
     A) Buy 200 shares at $35.60

     C) Buy 80 shares at $35.60
     D) Buy 2000 shares at $35.60
    Answer Explanation:
    Firm must aggregate multiple, same-priced customer limit orders to
    determine whether the de minimis standard has been exceeded. Because
    the firm is holding, but not displaying orders to purchase 170 shares, once
    a new order is received for more than 30 shares, the aggregate customer
    shares would exceed the 10% de minimis exception for the 20 displayed
    round lots and the quote must be updated.

    When effecting "net" trades with institutional customers, a firm must
    obtain the customer's consent prior to executing the transaction. The
    allowable methods to obtain consent differ between retail and institutional
    clients. Any entity with assets of at least $50 million (including an
    individual investor) is considered an institutional customer according to
    FINRA rules. The consent from institutional clients for net trades may be
    provided in a variety of ways, including a negative consent letter. The firm
    may also accept oral consent from the customer, as well as written
    consent.

    liquidate a block of 45,000 shares of stock, worth over $2 million.
    The firm decides to liquidate the block in parts over the course of
    the trading day. In regard to this block, when does firm's

    already been executed, the entire order must be filled and publicly
    reported to avoid a violation.

    firms act as an agent or broker they must charge fair and reasonable
    commissions. The general guideline is that a mark-up/mark-down or
    commission in excess of 5% is not reasonable.

37) A customer has entered a limit order to buy 200 shares of XYZ stock
    at $44.58, AON. If the issuer declares a cash dividend of 24.5 cents
    per share what will this order become on the ex-dividend date?
     A) The order will be cancelled

     C) Buy 200 @ 44.33, AON
     D) Buy 200 @ $44.58
    Answer Explanation:
    For buy limit and sell stop orders, cash dividends for fractional cents are
    rounded up (to the next whole cent) on ex-dividend dates. In this case,
    the dividend is rounded up to 25 cents and the limit price is reduced from
    $44.58 to $44.33. Note that special instructions such as AON (all-or-none)
    remain unchanged.

    pegged order.

     B) Sell stop order at or below $85
     C) Sell limit order at or below $85
     D) Sell stop order at or above $85
    Answer Explanation:

    protect the investor's position. With the sell stop, if the price hits $85 or
    below the order would be triggered and then become a market order to
    immediately sell the position in order to lock in the investor's profit.

    represents the first day on which an individual purchases stock without
    being entitled to the dividend.

48) A broker-dealer has received an order from a retail customer for a
    non-U.S. traded security. Broker-dealer policies regarding these
    securities
     A) Need not be maintained as there can never be any assurance that
    the customer will receive a favorable execution in a foreign market.
     B) Must stipulate that the firm will use reasonable diligence to obtain
    the most favorable terms available for the customer.
     C) Must direct this order to be transmitted to the international sales
    desk of the firm.
     D) Need not include provisions for the most favorable execution
    possible in light of differences between U.S. markets and foreign markets
    Answer Explanation:
    Although a security may not trade in the U.S., broker-dealers still have

    foreign security. This premise must be stipulated in specific written
    policies and procedures maintained by the firm.

49) A company "reverse splits" its stock on a 1-for-10 basis. If an
    investor holds 800 shares before the event, what will be the impact
    of the split, if any, on the total value of the investors' shares?
     A) Total value will decline by 10%
     B) Total value will not change
     C) Total value will decline by 90%
     D) Total value will increase by 10 times
    Answer Explanation:
    Stock splits and reverse splits don't change the total value of investors'
    holdings. For example, if the investor owned 800 shares at $1 per share
    before the 1-for-10 reverse split, he/she will own 80 shares at about $10
    per share after the event.

73) An OTC market maker is currently quoting $43.20-$43.75 22 x 17.
    Which of the following customer limit orders would require the
    market maker to update its displayed quote:
     A) Buy 100 shares at $42.75
     B) Buy 300 shares at $43.20
     C) Buy 300 shares at $42.75
     D) Buy 100 shares at $43.20
    Answer Explanation:
    The limit order display rule requires that market makers update their
    displayed quotes if a customer places a limit order that is (1) equal to the
    market maker's quote, and (2) equal to the BBO on the inter-dealer
    quotation system, and (3) represents more than a de minimis change
    (>10% than the market maker's quote) in relation to the size associated
    with the OTC Market Maker's bid or offer. Here, only the customer's buy
    order for 300 at $43.20 represents more than a de minimis change
    requiring the firm to update its displayed quote.

76) A customer has entered two open limit orders: buy 100 shares of
    XYZ Corp. at $35.15 and sell 100 shares of XYZ Corp. at $37.14. If
    XYZ then declares a cash dividend of $0.115 per share, what will
    each order be adjusted to on the morning of the ex-dividend date?
     A) Buy 100 XYZ at $35.03; sell 100 XYZ at $37.02
     B) Buy 100 XYZ at $35.15; sell 100 XYZ at $37.03
     C) Buy 100 XYZ at $35.26; sell 100 XYZ at $37.25
     D) Buy 100 XYZ at $35.03; sell 100 XYZ at $37.14
    Answer Explanation:
    Only orders entered below the market price are adjusted for cash
    dividends. These include buy limit, sell stop and sell stop limit. The sell
    limit order is not adjusted. Fractional-cent dividends are rounded up for
    adjustment purposes i.e., from 11.5 cents to 12.0 cents. Therefore, the
    buy limit order is adjusted downwards by $0.12 per share on the ex-
    dividend date, and the sell limit order is not adjusted.

    account at $10.76. The minimum price improvement that must be
    provided is $0.01, it could not trade better than the customer's order by
    less than $0.01.

87) KG Securities is an OTC market maker that displays priced
    quotations in OTC equity securities in an inter-dealer quotation
    system on a regular basis for its proprietary account and its
    customer accounts. Which of the follow criteria is not relevant to
    determine if KG Securities must update the size of its published its
    quotes?
     A) The size of the customer's limit price as compared to the size of KG
    Security's quote
     B) The customer's limit price as compared to the best bid and offer of
    the quote on the specific inter-dealer quotation system where KG Security
    is quoting
     C) The customer's limit price as compared to KG Securities' quote
     D) The customer's limit price as compared to the NBBO of the quote
    across all inter-dealer quotation systems
    Answer Explanation:
    When determining whether to update its quotes an OTC market maker
    does not consider the National Best Bid Offer (NBBO), but rather looks to
    the best bid and office on the specific quotation system where its quotes
    are posted. FINRA Rule 6460 requires OTC Market Makers that display
    priced quotations in an inter-dealer quotation system to immediately
    display the full size of any customer limit order held by the OTC Market
    Maker that (1) is priced equal to the bid or offer of the Market Maker; and
    (2) is priced equal to the BBO of the inter-dealer quotation system in
    which the OTC Market Maker is quoting; and (3) represents more than a
    de minimis change (10% of the size) in relation to the size associated with
    the OTC Market Maker's bid or offer.

     C) Every customer order KG Securities receives must be displayed
     D) Each customer order KG Securities receives that is at a price that is

    quotations in any inter-dealer quotation system to immediately update and
    publish any customer bid or offer that is at a price that improves the
    market maker's bid or offer. If the customer quote is at the same price at
    the market maker's quote, the market maker must update the size to
    reflect the customer limit order.

    same security, it must immediately thereafter (within 60 seconds) execute
    the customer order, based on the same terms as the firm's execution.

100) A company's stock splits 3-for-2. If it was trading at a price of $30
      before the split, approximately what will its share price be after the
      split?
       A) $15
       B) $20

      Stock splits don't alter the total value that shareholders have, only the
      price per share. A 3-for-2 split creates three shares for every two held
      before. Three shares after the split must be worth about the same as two
      shares before the split (two shares at $30 each = $60). Each of the three
      shares must be worth $20 after the split.

     must update its bid (within 30 seconds) to 18.48, for a size of 500 shares
     (the size of the customer bid).

124) An OTC market maker is currently quoting $43.20-$43.75 22 x 17.
     Which of the following customer limit orders would require the
     market maker to update its displayed quote?
      A) Sell 100 shares at $43.75
      B) Sell 200 shares at $43.75
      C) Buy 200 shares at $43.20
      D) Buy 100 shares at $43.20
     Answer Explanation:
     The limit order display rule requires that market makers update their
     displayed quotes if a customer places a limit order that is (1) equal to the
     market maker's quote, and (2) equal to the BBO on the inter-dealer
     quotation system, and (3) represents more than a de minimis change
     (>10% than the market maker's quote) in relation to the size associated
     with the OTC Market Maker's bid or offer. Here, only the customer's sell
     order for 200 represents more than a de minimis change requiring the
     firm to update its displayed quote.

     Broker-Dealer ABC buys 200 shares of XYZ stock at $60 per share
     and then sells the 200 shares to the customer at $60 per share, plus

      B) stopped stock transaction.
      C) qualified contingent trade.
      D) net transaction.
     Answer Explanation:
     This is a riskless principal trade as both legs of the trade are executed at
     the same price. The difference between a riskless principal trade and a
     net trade is that both legs of a riskless principal trade are done at the
     same price, whereas the two legs of a net trade are at different prices.

137) ABC Co. is announcing its quarterly earnings at 5 pm, after the
     market closes. A customer believes the earnings will be
     blockbuster and the stock price will move higher very quickly. She
     wants to quickly verify that the earnings are strong and then enter a
     market order to buy 800 shares of the stock, within a minute or less
     later, during extended market hours. What is the investor's main
     risk?
      A) Extra trading costs
      B) Trade cancellation risk
      C) Extraordinary volatility
      D) Timing lag
     Answer Explanation:
     Greater price volatility usually is a risk factor in extended hours trading.
     This risk is amplified when there are news announcements, such as
     earnings. Stocks often soar or sink quickly after earnings are released,
     only to reverse the move later or during normal market hours the next
     day, when there may be more context to the news (for example,
     research analysts' views) and greater trading volume.

      A) No, because the order is for a penny stock.
      B) Yes, because the order was priced equal or better than the firm's
     quote.
      C) Yes, because the order is greater than the de minimums
     exception.
      D) No, because the order was executed upon receipt.
     Answer Explanation:
     The general rule requires firms display customer limit orders, but there
     are a variety of exceptions when an order does not need to be
     displayed. The rule excepts any customer limit order that is: executed
     upon receipt of the order; placed by a customer who expressly requests
     that the order not be displayed; an odd-lot order; a block size order;
     delivered immediately upon receipt to a national securities exchange or
     an ECN that widely disseminates such order; delivered immediately
     upon receipt to another OTC Market Maker that displays the order; or an
     all-or-none order. Because Gerald's order was executed upon receipt,
     the firm does not need to update its quote.

141) ABC stock's NBBO is $63.25-$63.32 when a sell limit order is
     entered by a client at $63.28. Is this a marketable limit order?
      A) Yes, because it can be filled immediately.
      B) No, because the order cannot immediately be executed at the limit
     price.
      C) Not unless the order can be executed within five minutes of order
     entry.
      D) No, because only buy orders can be marketable limit orders.
     Answer Explanation:
     Marketable limit orders can be filled immediately, given the current
     market price. This sell order is three cents above the best bid price
     (63.25), so it cannot be filled immediately. It is a resting limit order, not a
     marketable limit order.

      C) how persistent the rep is in pushing the trade, against the client's
     wishes.
      D) how much information the rep gives the client about the trade.
     Answer Explanation:
     An unsolicited trade occurs when the client initiates the trade on his/her

     broker. Brokers can protect themselves by documenting all unsolicited
     trades.

     dividend of 25 cents per share. What adjustment will be made to
     resting buy limit orders on the ex-dividend date?
      A) None, because only sell limit, not buy limit orders, are adjusted
      B) The limit price will be reduced by 25 cents per share
      C) It depends on instructions the stock issuer has provided to the
     transfer agent
      D) The limit price will be increased by 25 cents per share
     Answer Explanation:
     For cash dividends, orders entered at or below the market (buy limit and
     sell stop) are reduced by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend
     date. The customer who placed the order can override this adjustment
     with a do-not-reduce (DNR) instruction.

152) A customer tells her broker that she wants to buy a large amount of
     a volatile stock. The broker discourages this but the customer does
     it anyway. Later, after losing money, she sues him for making an
     unsuitable recommendation. The key to the broker's defense may
     be that
      A) the trade was not discretionary.
      B) the customer is quite wealthy.
      C) the trade was unsolicited.
      D) the stock was highly volatile.
     Answer Explanation:
     An unsolicited trade occurs when the client initiates the trade on his/her
     own. A solicited trade involves a recommendation by the broker. The
     difference is that solicited trades must be suitable, but unsolicited trades
     do not constitute recommendations and thus are not subject to the same
     standard.

      D) A separate trading unit protected by a system of information

166) Broker-dealer C receives a customer limit order to sell 1,000 shares
     of an OTC equity at $59, at a time when C's best offer to sell the
     same stock is at a higher price. Broker Dealer C must immediately
     display the customer limit order, unless it is which type of order?
      A) Fill or kill (FOK)
      B) All or none (AON)
      C) Day Order

     Answer Explanation:
     An AON limit order is one exception to the requirement to immediately
     display a customer limit order on better terms than the member's
     bid/offer. Since it has the AON qualifier it is not comparable to a straight
     limit order.

167) A customer has entered an order to buy 200 shares of ABC Co.
     stock at $45.25 per share. ABC has recently declared a cash
     dividend of $0.20 per share, payable to holders of record on
     Wednesday, May 4th. How will the order have been adjusted if it is
     still on the books as of the record date?
      A) The order will not be adjusted and instead remain on the books at
     "buy 200 shares at $45.25"
      B) Prior to the open on Monday, it will be adjusted to "buy 200 shares
     at $45.05"
      C) Prior to the open on Tuesday, it will be adjusted to "buy 200
     shares at $45.05"
      D) Prior to the open on Tuesday, it will be adjusted to "buy 200
     shares at $45.45"
     Answer Explanation:
     Buy limit, sell stop and sell stop limit orders are reduced by the amount
     of a cash dividend prior to the open of trading on the ex-dividend date.
     Remember, that the ex-dividend date for regular way trades is always
     one business day prior to the record date. Therefore, this buy limit order
     is adjusted downwards by $0.20 prior to the open of trading on Tuesday.

168) Under FINRA's Standards of Commercial Honor and Principles of
     Trade all of the following may be considered by a firm when
     charging a commission in an agency transaction, except:
      A) market conditions with respect to such security at the time of the
     transaction
      B) the fact that the firm is entitled to a profit
      C) the expense of executing the order
      D) the value of any service rendered by reason of the firm's
     experience
     Answer Explanation:
     Commissions charged in agency transactions must be fair and
     reasonable. In determining fair and reasonable commissions a firm may
     consider market conditions with respect to such security at the time of
     the transaction, the expense of executing the order and the value of any
     service rendered by reason of the firm's experience in and knowledge of
     such security and the market therefor. When executing trades in an
     agency basis, however, the commission does not contemplate the fact
     that the firm is entitled to a profit.

169) In which case will an open buy limit order not be adjusted by the

      C) When the order is marked Good Till Cancelled "GTC"
      D) When the order is for less than a round lot
     Answer Explanation:
     The instruction DNR (Do Not Reduce) advises the member firm not to
     reduce buy limit orders for the value of any cash dividends paid. Also,
     orders are not adjusted for dividends of less than one cent.

      C) The right of the firm to make a profit

     transaction. The broker-dealer's profitability or profit targets may not be
     used as a pricing factor when trading in an agency capacity.

      D) Paired order
     Answer Explanation:
     The goal of matched orders is to create an appearance of demand so
     others will buy the security at a higher price. Matched orders are a
     violation.

175) A company declares a dividend payable in either cash or securities,
     at the shareholder's option. What adjustment must be made in the
     price of open orders?
      A) Reduction by the value of cash
      B) Reduction on a pro rata basis for both cash and securities
      C) Reduction by the value of securities
      D) Reduction by the value of cash or securities, whichever is greater
     Answer Explanation:
     In this case, it is the shareholder's option to take either cash or
     securities. Presumably, the shareholder will elect the option with the
     greater value. So, the open order price is adjusted by the greater
     amount.

      D) A directed order
     Answer Explanation:

      C) For quotes that are priced within 5% of the NBBO
      D) For quotes that are priced within 10% of the NBBO
     Answer Explanation:

     therefore is not required to be displayed - if it is less than or equal to 10
     percent of the displayed size associated with a market maker's bid or
     offer. It does not look to the NBBO.

      C) Is always considered reasonable
      D) May be considered unreasonable or unfair
     Answer Explanation:
     A mark-up pattern of 5% or less may be considered unfair or
     unreasonable, depending on the facts and circumstances of the
     transaction. Remember, the 5% is a policy, not a hard and fast rule
     (firms charging under 5% can still be found to be charging unreasonable
     fees).

      B) the customer has given the broker blanket verbal approval to act
     on timely tips.

     behalf.
      D) the customer approves the buy order.
     Answer Explanation:

     split?
      A) It must be adjusted in price only, not number of shares
      B) It must be adjusted in both price and number of shares
      C) Nothing

     adjusted in the event of a forward stock split (or cash dividend). If the
     split had been a reverse split (e.g. 1:4) then all open orders are
     cancelled.

193) Registered Rep G is walking down the hall of his firm and hears
     somebody whisper on the phone "block buy of ABC Co. tomorrow."
     He doesn't know any details about the trade, such as buyer or
     quantity. But he decides to buy a few shares for his own account
     anyway, because there has not been any public word about such a
     block trade. Is he front-running?
      A) No, because the source of the information is not an insider
      B) No, because his trade is not based on solid information
      C) Yes, because the information came from within his own firm
      D) Yes, because partial advance knowledge of a block trade is
     enough
     Answer Explanation:
     Partial knowledge of an imminent block trade can be enough to trigger
     front-running, if it is material and non-public and the trader has
     knowledge that the transaction will be agreed upon imminently. The
     source of the information is irrelevant.

194) A group of traders coordinates orders on both sides of the market,
     so as to give the appearance of larger demand for a stock than
     actually exists. This practice is
      A) allowed, but only if it is documented in writing.
      B) considered to be a violation of fiduciary duty to customers.
      C) considered to be collusion.
      D) allowed, but only if all participants are not market makers.
     Answer Explanation:
     Collusion is a manipulative prohibited practice in which traders
     coordinate prices or bid-ask spreads.

195) Registered Rep W hears material information about an imminent
     block sale transaction to sell shares of ABC Co. If he buys put
     options on the company's stock, is he front-running?
      A) Yes, if they are in-the-money
      B) No, because the securities must be of the same type
      C) No, because options are specifically exempt
      D) Yes, if he does so before the block trade is completed and
     reported
     Answer Explanation:
     The rule against front-running does not require the trade to be in the
     same security as the block. It can be a related financial instrument, or a
     security underlying the security involved in the block. Buying put options
     is akin to selling stock.

196) How often must regular and rigorous reviews of the overall quality
     of order executions occur, for a member who routes customer
     orders to another broker-dealer on an automated, non-discretionary
     basis?
      A) Semi-annually
      B) Quarterly
      C) Monthly
      D) Annually
     Answer Explanation:
     The reviews must be conducted on a security-by-security basis and by
     type of order. They must be conducted quarterly, at minimum.

197) For purposes of FINRA's rule against front-running, information
     about a block transaction is made publicly available when
      A) It is announced by the issuer
      B) It is generally well known to the investment community
      C) The entire block transaction has been completed and reported
      D) It is prominently posted in the media or online
     Answer Explanation:
     FINRA rules clarify that the whole block must be traded and reported for
     the information to be publicly available. Trading based on material
     information before this is front-running.

198) An investor enters a primary peg to sell 100 shares at $65.10 at a
     time when the best bid is $64.00, and the best offer is $65.25. If the
     best bid and best offer subsequently moves down to $63.10 and
     $65.00 respectively, what will the pegged order be repriced at?
      A) $63.10
      B) $65.00
      C) $65.10
      D) $65.25
     Answer Explanation:
     A primary peg to sell tracks the best offer. However, because the
     investor has a limit price of $65.10, the order will never be priced below
     that amount, even if the best offer moves lower than $65.10.

200) Which of the following methods may be used to obtain the consent
     of retail customers for net trades?
      A) Receive verbal consent from the client prior to the trade
      B) Provide the client with a negative consent letter prior to the trade
      C) Receive written consent from the client by settlement date of the
     transaction
      D) Receive written consent from the client prior to the trade
     Answer Explanation:
     For retail customers, authorizations must be obtained on a written order-
     by-order basis. This is different than for institutional customers, which
     allows for a negative consent letter, or written or verbal consent on a
     trade-by-trade basis.

     hours. If the firm allows processing of limit orders outside normal market
     hours the rule applies to these orders at all times.

204) On Monday, January 2nd, ABC Inc. declares a $0.10 dividend
     payable on Monday, Jan 16 to all shareholders of record as of
     Thursday, Jan 12. When will be the ex-dividend date for cash
     settled trades in the security?
      A) January 12
      B) January 10
      C) January 9
      D) January 13
     Answer Explanation:
     Cash settled trades settle on the same day. Therefore, an investor could
     buy stock on the record date and still settle in time to receive the
     dividend. Therefore, the ex-dividend date for a cash settled trade will be
     the business day after the record date.

205) A buy limit order has been placed for 5 shares. If a 3-for-2 stock
     split then occurs, how many shares will appear on the adjusted
     order, after the open on the ex-distribution date?
      A) 3
      B) 7
      C) 7.5
      D) 8
     Answer Explanation:
     Technically, a 3-for-2 stock split will produce 7.5 new shares. However, if
     the calculation produces a fractional number of shares, the order is
     adjusted down to the next whole number of shares. To calculate the new
     number of shares, multiply by the first number of the split and divide by
     the second: 5 x 3 / 2 = 7.5, which again, is rounded down to 7.
