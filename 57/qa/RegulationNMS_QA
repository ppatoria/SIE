22) If the NBBO in an NMS stock is $38.50-$38.52, which of the following
    transactions is a trade-through?
     A) Sold 100 at $38.51
     B) Bought 100 at $38.53
     C) Sold 100 at $38.50

    price above the national best ask or a sell transaction at a price below the
    national best bid.

34) A customer is long 11,000 shares of XYZ stock. At the same time, the
    customer has sold 30 call options on the stock and bought 20 call
    options on the stock. What is the customer's net long position in the
    stock?
     A) 5,000 shares
     B) 8,000 shares
     C) 10,000 shares
     D) 13,000 shares
    Answer Explanation:
    Any short call option positions must be subtracted from long stock
    positions in the same stock to determine the customer's net position. In
    this case, the investor's net long position is reduced by 30 call options
    (each representing 100 shares) or 3,000 shares. Therefore, 11,000
    shares long 3,000 shares short = 8,000 shares net long. Note that the
    long call option positions are only relevant to the net long position if the
    customer has exercised the options.

     A) $28.06
     B) $28.74

     D) $30.27
    Answer Explanation:
    To calculate yesterday's closing price, divide the opening price by (1 - %
    decline.) $32 / .88 = $36.36. Then, multiply this by .80 to determine the
    price that represents a 20% decline from yesterday's closing price. $36.36
    * .8 = $29.09.

     B) The 700 short shares only
     C) Both the 500 long and 700 short shares
     D) No shares
    Answer Explanation:

    position in such securities in the account. With a net short position, as in
    this case, there is no ownership in the position with respect to short-sale
    regulation. The shorts cancel out an equal amount of longs, leaving a net
    position of 200 shares short.

38) XYZ common stock, an S&P 500 component, is currently trading
    103-104 with a reference price of 100. At 2pm an order is entered to
    buy 300 shares at 108. What will be the impact of this order on the
    market for XYZ stock?
     A) The order creates a straddle state and trading will continue.
     B) The order will cause trading to be halted.
     C) The order will have no impact on the current market.
     D) The price of the order will be adjusted and the stock will enter a limit
    state.
    Answer Explanation:
    When an order comes in that is aggressively priced outside the LULD
    band (i.e. bid above the upper end or offered below the lower band),
    Nasdaq will price slide the order to the band. In this case, the 108 bid
    would be priced down to 105, which is the upper end up the LULD range
    (100 + 5%). The stock would then enter a 15-second limit state.

     A) They decrease by 20%
     B) They are not in force
     C) They double
     D) They increase by 20%
    Answer Explanation:

40) A customer is short 700 shares of ABC stock and has exercised call
    options allowing her to purchase 1,500 shares of the same stock. If
    the investor then places an order to sell 1,000 shares, how should
    the order ticket be marked?

     B) 1,000 shares sold long
     C) 800 shares sold long, and 200 shares sold short
     D) All shares sold short exempt
    Answer Explanation:
    At the time of the sale, the customer is net long 800 shares. Therefore,
    200 shares are being sold short and 800 are being sold long.
    Alternatively, the order ticket could be marked as a short sale for all
    shares.

43) A Nasdaq listed option trades for $8.90 at a time when the last sale
    price is $8.75 and the theoretical price is $8.20 Under the Nasdaq
    obvious error rule, what will be the final price of the trade?
     A) $8.90
     B) $8.75
     C) $8.50
     D) $8.35
    Answer Explanation:
    Under the Nasdaq obvious error rule, Nasdaq will adjust a trade if it is a
    more than a defined amount away from the theoretical price. For options
    with a theoretical price between $5.01 and $10.00, the band is $0.50.
    Since this trade occurs outside that $0.50 range, it is an obvious error.
    For options with a theoretical price above $3.00, the price will be adjusted
    to $0.30 away from the theoretical price - $8.50.

    Therefore, as long as the preferred stock has been tendered for
    conversion, then the order ticket will be marked long.

55) XYZ common stock, an S&P 500 component, is currently trading
    103-104 with a reference price of 100. At 2pm an order is entered to
    buy 300 shares at 108. Entry of this order will cause XYZ stock to

     A) straddle state
     B) trading halt since the bid breaches the limit up range
     C) limit state
     D) circuit breaker
    Answer Explanation:
    When an order comes in that is aggressively priced outside the LULD
    band (i.e. bid above the upper end or offered below the lower band),
    Nasdaq will price slide the order to the band. In this case, the 108 bid
    would be priced down to 105, which is the upper end up the LULD range
    (100 + 5%). The stock would then enter a 15-second limit state.

    protected offer. Here, the sale of securities at a price lower than the
    highest bid would be a trade through. On the purchase side, a trade-
    though would occur if the execution occurred a price higher than the
    current protected offer.

59) A wealthy customer has asked ABC Securities, an NMS market
    maker, to help her sell 100,000 shares of a stock. The same
    customer is also using another market maker to sell another large
    block of the same stock. The customer requests that her two market
    makers work together to coordinate their quotes to ensure both
    blocks are executed under the best possible circumstances. Under
    what circumstance may ABC honor her request?
     A) none, because it would be illegal quote rigging
     B) the two broker-dealers may not trade her stock directly between
    each other
     C) her request must be made in writing and approved by ABC's
    compliance departments
     D) all trades must be made on an agency basis
    Answer Explanation:
    It is not permissible for market makers to enter quotes purely for the
    purpose of creating a false appearance of market activity or manipulating
    stock prices. This is called quote rigging. The SEC has taken disciplinary
    action against market makers who worked together to coordinate the
    entry of quotes.

69) A broker-dealer sells 400 shares of stock for a customer on
    Thursday, October 9. If the shares aren't delivered by the settlement
    date, the sale must be closed out by the open of trading on Tuesday,
    October 14. What type of sale is this?

     B) a long sale
     C) either a long or short sale by a market maker
     D) a short sale
    Answer Explanation:
    Remember that the close-out requirement is the open of business on T+5
    for long sales of stock by anyone and also for short sales by market
    makers (in bona fide market-making activity). However, the close-out
    requirement is the open of business on T+3 for short sales of stock by
    anyone except a market maker engaged in bona fide market-making
    activity.

    used to determine if a trade is defined as an obvious error.
     A) Execution price
     B) Theoretical price
     C) Bid-ask midpoint

    the cancellation of a trade if it is outside a certain range from the stock's
    last sale price. Nasdaq obvious error rule for options will result in a trade
    being adjusted to a designated amount away from its theoretical value, if
    the price of the trade is a certain range from that value.

76) ABC Securities makes a market in an NMS stock. Its quote is 200
    shares bid at 32.04 and 300 shares offered at 32.09. If XYZ market
    maker enters an order to buy 500 shares at 32.09 and simultaneously
    there is market-moving news in the stock, can ABC change its
    quote?
     A) yes, after filling 300 shares of XYZ's order
     B) yes, because the quote change is based on market-moving
    information
     C) no, because ABC is offering fewer shares than XYZ wants to buy
    and can't fill the whole order
     D) no, the quote must not be changed until the full size of XYZ's order
    is transacted
    Answer Explanation:
    Market makers can change their quotes at any time, and they usually do
    change quotes based on market-moving news. However, they must not
    back away from quotes. ABC has offered to sell up to 300 shares at
    32.09, so 300 shares of XYZ's order must be filled at that price. After
    filling the order, ABC can change its quote based on the news.

    his personal account is considered a short sale and the order
    memorandum must be marked accordingly as a short sale.

80) The compliance director for a broker-dealer tells Jill, a trader, that
    she is threatening the firm's trade reporting status by coordinating
    her trades with another trading desk of the same firm. The negative
    impact of this is
     A) the trades involved in coordinated actions will have to be nullified.
     B) the firm will not be able to aggregate all net positions in securities.
     C) the firm will be required to aggregate all net positions in securities.
     D) the firm will have to establish separate compliance procedures for
    each desk.
    Answer Explanation:
    The key term here is independent trading unit aggregation. This status
    allows the firm to report net positions in securities by trading desk, not for
    the firm as a whole. To qualify for the status, desks must be independent
    and not coordinate trades with other units of the firm.

    fact that shares can't be found or delivered on settlement.

     B) $1,600
     C) $1,640
     D) $1,720
    Answer Explanation:
    To calculate a Level 3 halt price given an opening price follow the steps
    below: 1) Divide the opening price by (1 - % decline). This solves for
    yesterday's closing price. 2) Multiply yesterday's closing price by 80%
    (0.8). $1,800 / .9 = $2,000 yesterday closing price. $2,000 X .8 = $1,600.

94) If an IPO falls by 10% or more on the first day of trading, does it
    trigger a short-sale circuit-breaker?
     A) Yes, because the underwriters determine the reference price
     B) No, because there is no listing market
     C) No, because there is no prior-day's close or reference price
     D) Yes, because the opening trade determines the reference price
    Answer Explanation:
    The first trading day a circuit-breaker can trigger on an IPO is the second
    trading day, with the reference price being the closing best bid on the first
    day. It can't trigger on the first day because there is no prior-day closing
    bid to serve as reference.

95) When can a broker-dealer mark sale orders in connection with
    unwinding index arbitrage positions for its own account as a long
    sale, even if the firm is not actually long?
     A) The S&P is down less than 7% from its previous closing value
     B) Never
     C) The S&P is down less than 20% from its previous closing value
     D) The NYSE is down less than 2% from its previous closing value
    Answer Explanation:
    Under certain circumstances, such as when a firm is unwinding an index
    arbitrage position, the rules permit a broker dealer to mark a sale as a
    long sale even though the firm is actually short. That is, the firm is
    deemed to be long the securities it is selling. This rule, however, does not
    apply when the NYSE has declined by two percent or more from its
    closing value on the previous day.

96) Which of the following is true regarding Nasdaq's rules for clearly
    erroneous trades and obvious options errors?
     A) The obvious error rule will adjust the price of the trade while the
    clearly erroneous rule will cancel the trade.
     B) Both rules require cancellation of trades.
     C) Both rules allow Nasdaq to adjust a trade to a price relative to the
    last sale price.
     D) The clearly erroneous rule will adjust the price of the trade while the
    obvious error rule will cancel the trade.
    Answer Explanation:
    Nasdaq's rule for clearly erroneous trades in equity securities will lead to
    the cancellation of a trade if it is outside a certain range from the stock's
    reference price. Nasdaq's obvious error rule for options will result in a
    trade being adjusted to a designated amount away from its theoretical
    value, if the price of the trade is a certain range from that value.

97) A broker-dealer sells short 200 shares of stock and then fails to
    deliver the securities. The firm is then required to close out the fail-
    to-deliver by the 13th settlement day after trade date. What type of
    securities are these?
     A) securities sold short by a market maker
     B) securities with restrictions preventing good delivery
     C) threshold securities
     D) securities in thinly traded or delisted companies
    Answer Explanation:
    Remember that the close-out requirement is T+3 for short sales in
    general. It is T+5 for long sales in general and also long or short sales by
    market markets (for bona fide market-making). It is T+35 for securities
    with restrictions and it is T+13 for threshold securities. The definition of
    threshold securities is not important for the exam.

98) XYZ Securities executes trades for an institutional client that often
    enters very similar quotes on both sides of the market to buy and
    sell the same stock, at about the same time. The broker who handles
    this account refers it to her compliance department to investigate.
    What test should the compliance department use to determine
    whether XYZ should continue to display these quotes?
     A) Do the quotes usually move the market in a clear direction, to the
    detriment of other participants?
     B) Are multiple independent traders placing quotes on behalf of the
    same client?
     C) Do the quotes accomplish an investment objective consistent with
    the client's profile?
     D) Do the client's quotes reflect true, bona fide prices?
    Answer Explanation:
    With respect to displaying or circulating customer quotes, the member
    must believe they represent true, bona fide prices. If investors are
    colluding (even within the same account or company) by placing offsetting
    to manipulate prices or increase trading volume, the quotes probably
    aren't true and bona fide.

     A) The exchanges

    declared by specific exchanges, or by FINRA in the OTC market.

      D) Orders cannot be entered and trading is prohibited.
     Answer Explanation:
     During the 15 second limit state, trading will continue. If the limit state
     quote persists for 15 seconds, trading will be halted for five minutes. If
     the limit state quote is executed or cancelled the security will exit the
     limit state and trading will continue uninterrupted. During a halt under
     LULD, orders can be entered but trades cannot be executed

109) A Nasdaq listed option trades for $2.50 at a time when the last sale
     price is $2.45 and the theoretical price is $3.00. Under the Nasdaq
     obvious error rule, what will be the final price of the trade?
      A) $2.45
      B) $2.50
      C) $2.60
      D) $2.70
     Answer Explanation:
     Under the Nasdaq obvious error rule, Nasdaq will adjust a trade if it is
     more than a defined amount away from the theoretical price. For options
     with a theoretical price between $2.00 and $5.00, the band is $0.40.
     Since this trade occurs outside the band, the price will be adjusted. For
     options with a theoretical price of $3.00 or greater, the adjustment is to
     $0.30 away from the theoretical price.

     is entered at $65.36,
      A) trading in the stock will halted for 5 minutes.
      B) a straddle state will exist.

      D) the bid price will slide to $65.18, but no limit state will be triggered.
     Answer Explanation:
     If an order is entered at a price aggressively outside a LULD band,
     trading systems adjust the price to the band a price slide and the
     stock enters a limit state. In this case, the band is 5% above (and below)
     the reference, or at $65.18 ($62.08 x 1.05).

115) When can the short-sale circuit-breaker rules take effect on a
     covered security?
      A) normal market hours and after hours trading
      B) pre-market hours and normal market hours
      C) normal market hours
      D) pre-market, normal market hours, and after-hour trading
     Answer Explanation:

     compared to the previous day's close during normal market hours it
     won't trigger a circuit breaker.

      C) Reasonable grounds to believe the security can be borrowed
      D) An affidavit stating that the security can be borrowed

     their reference price. The reference price is the last sale price for
     exchanged-listed securities and the prevailing market price just prior to
     the time of the trade for OTC securities.

122) XYZ Broker-Dealer executes a short sale of stock for a customer
     and then fails to deliver the security in timely fashion or close out
     the fail. Which of the following situations is an exception that will
     allow XYZ to avoid restrictions on future short sales?
      A) the stock is on FINRA's hard-to-borrow list
      B) XYZ has entered a definitive borrowing agreement to obtain the
     security
      C) the stock is experiencing exceptional price or volume volatility
      D) XYZ has not in the past shown a consistent pattern of fails-to-
     deliver on short sales in any equity security
     Answer Explanation:
     There are two exceptions to the restriction on equity short sale fails-to-

     short sale is entered after the security has been borrowed. The other
     applies if the broker-dealer has entered into a definite borrowing
     arrangement to obtain the security.

124) A Nasdaq listed option trades for $17.30 at a time when the last sale
     price is $16.00 and the theoretical price is $17.00 Under the Nasdaq
     obvious error rule, what will be the final price of the trade?
      A) $17.80
      B) $17.30
      C) $16.80
      D) $16.50
     Answer Explanation:
     Under the Nasdaq obvious error rule, Nasdaq will adjust a trade if it is a
     more than a defined amount away from the theoretical price. For options
     with a theoretical price between $10.01 and $20.00, the band is $0.80.
     Since this trade occurs inside the band, it is not an error, therefore the
     price will not be adjusted.

      B) trade through
      C) mark-up

126) For purposes of short-sale regulation, what is an aggregation unit?
      A) 100 shares or more
      B) A group of traders within a single firm with similar objectives or
     strategies
      C) A group of clients with similar objectives or strategies
      D) All long shares or short shares held by the same client
     Answer Explanation:
     An aggregation unit is a group of traders within a single firm with similar
     objectives or strategies and that can separately determine their unit's net
     long or short position when marking order tickets without considering the
     positions of the entire firm. For example, a prop trading desk may make
     up one aggregation unit. Individual traders may be assigned to just one
     aggregation unit at a time.

129) Under Regulation SHO, what determines whether the price of a
     covered security has decreased by 10% or more from the covered
     security's closing price as of the end of regular trading hours on
     the prior day?
      A) the lowest displayed bid
      B) the highest displayed bid
      C) the highest bid - displayed or undisplayed
      D) the lowest reported trade
     Answer Explanation:
     To determine if the price of a covered security has declined by 10% or
     more from its prior day's closing price - triggering the short sale price
     restrictions - the covered security's price is based on trades reported
     during regular trading hours. The system will not trigger based on quotes
     (bids or offers).

130) Which one of the following does not qualify as a short exempt
     sale?
      A) Short sale made by a broker-dealer on a riskless principal basis
      B) Short sale made by a syndicate member in connection with an IPO
     over-allotment
      C) Short sale made by a market maker for a customer's odd-lot order
      D) Short sale made by a broker-dealer made in connection with
     independent unit aggregation
     Answer Explanation:
     Independent unit aggregation allows each unit (e.g., trading desk) at a
     firm to determine its own positions, as opposed to having to aggregate
     all positions for that particular security across the entire firm.
     Independent unit aggregation does not specifically qualify for a short
     exempt sale, while all the other choices are scenarios when an order
     ticket can be marked short exempt.

131) A Tier 1 stock has a reference price of $41.60 and at 10:30 am is
     quoted at $39.75. Which of the following quotes will trigger a limit
     state?
      A) Sell at $43.68
      B) Sell at $39.52
      C) Buy at $39.16
      D) Buy at $39.52
     Answer Explanation:
     For a Tier 1 stock trading at a price above $3 (not at the open or close),
     the LULD band is 5%. On the lower level, a limit state is triggered by a
     national best offer (sell quote) that is 5% lower than the reference price
     or $39.52 ($41.60 x .95) and on the upper level triggered by a national
     best bid (buy quote) that is 5% higher than the reference price or $43.68
     ($41.60 x 1.05).

132) For purposes of the short-sale circuit-breaker, an uptick is defined
     as a displayed price
      A) Above the best bid
      B) Equal to or above the best offer
      C) Above the best offer
      D) Equal to or above the best bid
     Answer Explanation:
     An uptick means that the displayed quote price increases from the
     current best bid. The best bid is always the reference point, and the
     transaction price must be at least one increment (usually 1 cent) above
     it.

133) If a listed equity has a Reference Price of $100 per share, what
     trade price will trigger a FINRA consideration of a clearly erroneous

      B) $99.27
      C) $102.45
      D) $104.80
     Answer Explanation:
     The trade price must be 3% above or below the Reference Price. A
     trade at $104.80 is up 4.8% from the Reference Price and falls outside
     the percentage band. Any trade below $97 also would trigger a FINRA
     review.

      C) To temporarily withdraw two-sided quotes
      D) To avoid a trade-through rule violation
     Answer Explanation:
     A broker-dealer or exchange raises a self-help alert when another
     broker-dealer or exchange is experiencing a technical problem. This
     allows quotes of the troubled entity to be bypassed for order routing, for
     purposes of complying with the trade-through rule.

     who promises to deliver the stock from another account within 24
     hours after the order is placed. Should G mark the order ticket as a
     short-sale?
      A) Not if the customer deposits sufficient cash
      B) Yes, because the shares are held in another account
      C) Not if the broker dealer reasonably expects the securities to be
     controlled by settlement
      D) Yes, because the shares aren't physically present when the order
     is placed
     Answer Explanation:
     An order need not be marked short or short exempt if the broker dealer
     reasonably expects the securities to be in physical possession or control
     no later than settlement - which normally is T+2.

137) At 2:45 pm, a trader places a market on close (MOC) order to sell
     600 shares of stock. At 3:02 pm, a Level 3 trading halt is triggered
     in the stock. What will happen to the MOC order?
      A) It will be converted into a limit order, at the price of the last trade
     before the Level 3 halt took effect.
      B) It will be cancelled.
      C) It will be executed at the closing price.
      D) It will be executed at the price of the last trade before the Level 3
     halt took effect.
     Answer Explanation:
     Whenever a Level 3 trading halt stops trading for the rest of the day, all
     MOC orders are cancelled, because there is no closing cross. The

139) A broker-dealer guarantees to fill a customer's order at $21.45 per
     share. However, before execution the customer is allowed to
     search for a better price from another market participant. If the
     customer agrees to the $21.45 price guarantee from the broker-
     dealer when a better price is available, is this a violation of the
     Trade-Through Rule?
      A) No, it is not a violation because intermarket sweep orders are an
     exception to the rule.
      B) No, it is not a violation because print protection trades are an
     exception to the rule.
      C) No, it is not a violation because stopped orders are an exception to
     the rule.
      D) Yes, it is a violation because the customer did not receive the best
     execution price.
     Answer Explanation:
     Stopped orders (stop stock trades) occur when broker-dealers offer
     customers a specific price along with the opportunity to find a better
     price elsewhere. This is an exception to the Trade-Through Rule. Note
     that intermarket sweet orders and print protection trades are also
     exceptions to the rule, but not the scenario being described in the
     question.

164) ABC Securities, a broker-dealer, wishes to continue trading
     through an exchange after a self-help alert has been raised against
     the exchange. In this case, the main impact of the alert will be that

     quotes.

171) The NBBO for an NMS stock is $31.12- $31.14. What price would
     cause a buy order to be executed outside the quote?
      A) Below $31.14
      B) Above $31.14
      C) Below $31.12
      D) Above $31.12
     Answer Explanation:
     For buy orders, a trade outside the quote would be higher than the
     national best offer, which is $31.14 in this case. For sell orders, it is
     lower than the national best bid. In an "outside the quote" trade the
     customer does not receive a price as favorable as the quote. Unless
     there is an exception available, it is a violation to execute a trade for a
     customer not at the best price.

172) If the national best bid for ABC Stock is $15.21 x $15.24 and a
     short-sale circuit-breaker is in effect, what is the lowest price at
     which an order marked short can be executed?
      A) $15.21
      B) $15.22
      C) $15.24
      D) The order can't be executed at any price
     Answer Explanation:
     The order must be executed on an uptick - above the national best bid.
     Technically, it must be displayed on an uptick in relation to the national
     best bid. So, a limit order could be displayed and executed with a bid of
     $15.22, one increment above the national best bid of $15.21.

174) If a covered stock declines in price by 10% for two trading days in a

198) A market maker wants to increase its order flow from ABC
     Securities, a broker-dealer. If ABC agrees to route a given volume
     of its order flow to the market maker, the market maker says it will
     allow ABC to participate as an underwriter in an upcoming public
     offering. Under what circumstance is this arrangement allowed?
      A) It is not allowed because the compensation is considered an illegal
     kickback.
      B) ABC must adhere to the Order Protection Rule and best execution
     mandate and disclose payments to customers.

     originating firm (ABC) must: 1) adhere to the Order Protection Rule and
     best execution mandate; and 2) disclose any payments for order flow to

203) XYZ common stock, an S&P 500 component, is currently trading
     103-104 with a reference price of 100. At 2pm an order is entered to
     buy 300 shares at 105. Entry of this order will cause XYZ stock to
     enter a
      A) Straddle state, during which trading can continue.
      B) Straddle state, and trading will be halted.
      C) Limit state, and trading will be halted.
      D) Limit state, during which trading can continue.
     Answer Explanation:
     Under limit-up limit-down, an S&P 500 stock will enter a 15-second limit
     state when there is an offer at the LOWER end up the band (5% below
     the reference price) or a bid at the UPPER end of the band (5% above
     the reference price). If the limit state quote persists for 15 seconds,
     trading will be halted for five minutes. If the limit state quote is executed
     or cancelled the security will exit the limit state and trading will continue
     uninterrupted. If the bid and offer are on either side of the limit up or limit
     down range, the security is said to be in a straddle state, where the
     exchange will closely monitor trading to see if a halt is necessary.
