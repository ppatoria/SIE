alt #DarkSlateGray Voluntarily Withdrawal
    MarketMaker -> ADTMarketCenter: Voluntarily terminates two-sided quote
    note right
        After termination,
        they cannot re-register as a market maker
        in the same security for 20 business days.
        However, if the withdrawal is due to reasons
        beyond the market maker's control
        (e.g., corporate action, trading halt),
        and they enter a new two-sided quote on the
        same day or when trading resumes,
        registration is not terminated.

        Example: If a stock is halted on Monday, and
        the market maker terminates its two-sided quote,
        the market maker may resume a two-sided quote on
        Wednesday.
        If they don't, it's considered a voluntary
        termination.

        Stock Halted: Monday
        Quote Terminated

        such as due to keystroke mistakes.
