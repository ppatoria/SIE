  The trader identifies the securities they wish to short sell.
  The trader contacts their broker-dealer to initiate the short selling process.
  If the broker-dealer has the securities available, they will borrow them on behalf of the trader.
  If the broker-dealer does not have the securities available, they will attempt to locate them from other sources.
  If the securities are located, the broker-dealer will borrow them on behalf of the trader.
  If the broker-dealer has an agreement with an institutional investor to borrow securities, they will do so on behalf of the trader.
  If the securities are not available, the trader will need to wait until they become available.
  Once the trader has borrowed the securities, they can execute their short sell order.
  Trade settlement occurs on T + 3 business days after the trade date.
  If settlement fails, the trader may have additional time before regulatory penalties apply.
  After the short sale, the trader monitors the price of the securities to determine the optimal time to buy back.
  If the price decreases, the trader can execute their buy back order and settle the trade.
  If the price does not decrease, the trader will need to wait until it does.
