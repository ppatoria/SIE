title Dutch Auction Tender Offer

actor "Acquiring Company" as acquiring_company
participant "Shareholders" as shareholders

acquiring_company -> acquiring_company : Sets Price Range
acquiring_company -> acquiring_company : Defines Bidding Period
shareholders -> shareholders : Submit Bids (Quantity and Price) \n Within Price Range
acquiring_company -> acquiring_company : Determines Acceptance Priority \n Starts with Highest Price \n Works Down to Desired Quantity
note left
        Here's an example to illustrate this process:
        Let's say the acquiring company wants to
        purchase 10,000 shares and has received bids
        from shareholders at various prices within
        the price range. It starts by accepting bids
        with the highest prices until it reaches the
        10,000 shares target or exhausts the bids
        within the price range.

        This prioritization ensures that shareholders
        who are willing to sell their shares at higher
        prices have a better chance of having their
        bids accepted, but it also helps the acquiring
        company manage its budget and acquisition goals
        effectively.
end note
