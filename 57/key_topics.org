#+title: Chapter1 NMS
* SIPC
** Broker-dealers are required to be members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)
** which protects customer accounts against the loss of their securities if their broker- dealer becomes insolvent.

* Floor brokers, floor market makers, specialists, and designated market makers are all associated with exchanges.
* market maker can be used in reference to exchanges (e.g., Nasdaq) or OTC securities.
* Thinly traded securities may have a legitimate business reason for wanting market makers to continue publishing quotes
** but they cannot pay a market maker any type of compensation, directly or indirectly, to do so.
* The firm/MM must refuse the payment but may still initiate quotations.
* Firm Quotes/ Bona fide Quotes
** Backing away not allowed
*** Complainsts should be filed within five minutes.
** “Bona fide” means real or actual. Bona fide quotes (aka firm quotes) are quotes that a market maker must be able and willing to execute.
** Failing to do so is considered backing away.
** Complaints regarding backing away should be filed with regulators within five minutes.
** However, a failure to do so does not forgive the offending firm from liability.

* Round Lots/ Normal Unit of trading
** Quotes can only be displayed in Round Lots
*** The displayed size for a quote is in round lots of 100 shares.
*** A customer’s order for a mixed lot (e.g., 378 shares) would be entered into the system and displayed as three round lots (300 shares),
**** although all the shares (378) would be available for execution.
* Max allowable order sizes are between one and 999,999 shares.
* Odd-lot orders are permitted, but orders for fractional shares are not.
* A firm wishing to display an attributable quote will use its assigned primary or supplemental MPID.
* A firm wishing to display a non-attributable quote will use the MPID NSDQ.

* Attributable quotes or orders displayed with firms MPID (Primary or Secondary) .
* Non-attributable quotes and orders are anonymous firm  MPID is displayed as "NSDQ".

* Within 5 days of  becoming Market Maker; firm should start quoting.
** When a firm becomes a market maker in an additional name, it is typically effective on the same business day.
** The market maker must begin quoting the security by the open of trading five business days later.
* MPID
** Primary MPID
*** A firm’s primary MPID must be used for
**** market maker quotes,
**** Must always have a firm, two-sided quote.
**** passive market making and
**** stabilization.
** Supplemental MPID
*** Quotes do not need to be two-sided
*** Can be withdrawn at any time
** A market maker must report a trade using the same MPID that was used to execute it.
* MM should atleast have 1 round lot for the securities it is trading.
** A market maker's quotation obligation requires it be prepared to trade at least one normal unit of trading, which is defined as 100 shares.
** Example:
*** A market maker displays a quote of 32.10 x 32.15.
*** The assumption is that the bid and offer are available for 100 shares.
*** A customer seeking to buy 300 shares at 32.15 could expect execution of 100 shares at 32.15 from this market maker.
* Bona fide quotes (aka firm quotes)
* Backing away : failing to maintain firm quotes
** Complaint should be filed with regulater within 5 minutes.

* Decimal points permissible for quotes
** Listed stocks
*** less than $1
**** max 4 decimals

* Order matching priority
** price have priority over time and size
** Example
*** a customer limit order to buy at $15 and entered at 11:00am
*** would have priority over another customer limit order to buy at $14.99 that was entered at 10:55am.
** Size is considered after Price. If two limit orders are entered at the exact same time at the exact same price
*** the larger of the two orders will have priority and be filled first.
** Displayed orders will have priority over non-displayed orders at the same price.

* Price improvement and the taker of the liquidity
** Any potential price improvement goes to the taker of liquidity,
** which is the party that crosses the spread to execute an order against an existing quote.
** Example
*** if the current best bid on a stock is $30.25 on 1,000 shares and
*** a customer enter an order to sell 500 shares at $30.23,
*** the order will be executed at $30.25.
*** In this situation, the seller is the taker of liquidity
**** and receive a price improvement of $.02
**** as their order to sell at $30.23 is marketable because an investor is willing to pay up to $30.25.
* MM do not have an obligation to maintain quotes outside regular market hours.
* Market-Open  9.30-9.45 am
* Market-Close 3.35-4.00 pm
* Pring obligation [[./PricingObligationForNewQuotes.puml]]
** Designated percentage rule (Tier 1)
*** 20% of NBBO during market-open and market-close
*** 8% of NBBO between 9.45 AM to 3.35 PM (i.e. excluding market-open and market-close)
**** New quotes entered by a market maker must be within a designated percentage (typically 8%) of the NBBO.
**** Under the Nasdaq designated percentage rule, market makers can maintain quotes further from the inside market before 9:45 am and after 3:35 pm.
**** the designated percentage is increased to 20%, as there is often greater volatility and price movement at these times.
** Defined Limit rule (Tier 1)
*** 21.5% of NBBO during market-open and market-close.
*** 9.5% of NBBO between 9.45 AM to 3.35 PM i.e. excluding market-open and market-close
**** Existing quotes: Once the quote is entered, it must remain within defined limit of the NBBO (typically 9.5%).

* Withdrawal from Quoatation
** MM excused withdrawals :
*** 5 days -  Due to equipment malfunction, vacation, religious holiday
*** 60 days - For legal or regulatory reasons
**** such as an involuntary termination of a clearing agreement.
*** No specific time limit - If engaged in investment banking activities
*** MM possessing inside information should seek an excused withdrawal due to legal requirements.
**** The MM may be able to engage in passive market-making.
** MM voluntary withdrawal
*** Cannot re-register in that name for 20 business days.
*** Not required to submit additional filings or provide notice prior to withdrawal.
* Locking and Crossing
** Treated as markatable and executed
*** Firms may not submit locking or crossing quotes — instead, such quotes should be treated as marketable and executed.
*** In such case the limit order is considered as market order and executed.
*** example
**** the NBBO is 9.50 × 9.55.
**** If a customer places a sell limit at 9.49.
**** The firm should treat the order as a market order and execute against the 9.50 best bid.
** Exceptions whereby a market maker is permitted to enter a quote that would lock or cross the market:
*** The market center showing the locked quote is experiencing a system or display malfunction.
*** The quote is displayed at the time the best bid is above the best offer (crossed).
*** The quote is entered as an intermarket sweep order.
* opening and closing cross

* Trading halt
** The halt cross timeline:
*** Phase 1 (quote-only period): A MM can accept and enter customer quotes and orders.
*** Phase 2 (resume trading): The halt cross sets the re-opening price, orders execute, and regular trading begins.
** Trading halt is resumed by "halt cross" process.
** A market order received is held  until trading resumes with halt cross process.
** No trades can be executed
*** There is NOT any exception for block trades.
* ADF
** Does not route orders instead market participants must execute using their own private connectivity systems (e.g., an ATS).
** Does handle trade reports
*** Including accepting or declining trade reports.
* A market maker cannot accept any payments to initiate quotations.
** The firm must refuse the payment but could still quote the security.
* Riskless principal trades are permitted for NMS stocks and OTC equities, including penny stocks.
* Reg NMS covers, among other things,
** market access (Rule 610),
** order protection (Rule 611), and
** sub-penny pricing increments (Rule 612).

** NYSE stocks can be quoted over-the-counter on the Consolidated Quotation System (CQS).
* For listed stocks quotes of 4 decimals are only permitted for stocks trading for less than $1.

#+title: Chapter 2: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Equities
* Form 211 (Registration)
** Required To
*** start quoatation in OTC
*** Start quotation after 10 day SEC suspension (refile 211)
** Exception
*** Quotes represent unsolicited customer interest (i.e., customer orders).
**** Once the customer’s order is filled, or
**** if the customer withdraws (cancels) its interest,
**** the market maker can no longer quote the stock.
*** Recently Delisted Securities
*** Piggybacking exception
**** If a stock is delisted from Nasdaq or the NYSE, it can immediately be quoted OTC without a Form 211 filing.
* 15c2-11
** Rule: Mandatory for MM to obtaine and provide basic information of the security to initiate a quote in any OTC equity security.
*** Despite the security’s registration status or the issuer’s filings and disclosures
** Applies only MM for  OTC securities.
*** It does not apply to NMS stocks.
* The OTC Pink
** is only used for quoting equities.
*** Bonds, including senior debentures, are not quoted on the OTC venues.
** subject or non-firm quotes.
*** OTC Pink permits subject quotes (a quote with a price that may not be honored) provided they are indicated, and clearly designated, as not-firm, subject quotes.
** Registration (Form 211) not required but Due diligence (i.e. rule 15c2-11) is mandatory.

* Quote Withdrawal
** There is no penalty for a quote withdrawal by an OTC market maker as OTC equities do not have a continuous, firm-quote requirement.

* Natural and Non-Natural IOC
** Natural IOC     : An unpriced indication of interest that reflects a customer order or a desire to make a transaction in the security.
** Non-Natural IOC : Reflects an IOI for a market maker to transact for its own account.

*** settlement,
*** position consolidation, and
*** securities lending.
** prime brokers do not assist with anti-money laundering compliance.

** Prime brokers are must maintain minimum net capital of at least $1.5mm.

** A firm which cannot confirm that the shares are available to borrow may not execute a short sale for a customer.
*** e.g., the firm cannot obtain a locate because it cannot reach its prime broker
** For member firms that engage a clearing or prime broker ,
*** it must be determined whether the firm itself or
*** its clearing firm will make the short interest reports for the firm’s short positions.

* When a broker-dealer is determining
** its own net long or short position in a security
** it must aggregate all of its positions in that security
** unless it qualified for independent trading unit aggregation.
** Independent aggregation allows each trading desk (i.e., unit) to determine its own position,
** if all of the below requirements are met:
a) The broker-dealer has a written plan to identify each unit.
b) Each unit determines its own net position for every security.
c) Traders are assigned to only one unit.
d) Traders from one unit do not coordinate with trades in another unit.
* Threshold security list
** a list of securities with significant outstanding fails,
** is prepared and disseminated by the SRO that maintains the primary listing for the security.
a. FINRA publishes a list of OTC threshold securities.
b. Other SROs such as Nasdaq and NYSE publish their own threshold security lists.
** If a broker-dealer has executed a transaction in a threshold security
*** but has failed to deliver the security and
*** the fail consists for 13 consecutive settlement days,
*** the broker-dealer must close out the position on the 14th.
** For the closing out of short sales,
*** it is important to note not only that the close out is required on T+3 (settlement is T+2),
*** but also that it must be done at the beginning of the day.
* Short-Exempt
"Short-Exempt" refers to a type of short sale order that is exempt from the uptick rule,
which is a rule that restricts short sales to shares that are increasing in price.
Here's a simplified explanation of the points you provided:

1. **Orders Marked as Short Exempt**: An order ticket can be marked as "short exempt" under certain conditions. This means that the order is exempt from the uptick rule.

2. **Riskless Principal Trade**: One such condition is when a broker-dealer is executing a riskless principal trade for a customer. A riskless principal trade is when a broker-dealer buys or sells a security for its own account, and then immediately (or almost immediately) executes an offsetting transaction with a customer.

   For example, if a customer wants to buy 100 shares of Company A, the broker-dealer could first buy the 100 shares on the open market and then sell them to the customer. This would be a riskless principal trade because the broker-dealer is not taking on any market risk.

3. **Customer's Order and Offsetting Transaction**: The customer's order must be in place prior to the offsetting transaction, and both legs of the trade must be executed within 60 seconds of each other.

4. **Record Keeping**: The broker-dealer must maintain records that can readily reconstruct the trades. This is to ensure transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.

5. **Non-Regular Way Transaction**: A trade being a non-regular way transaction is a reason for marking an order ticket short exempt. A non-regular way transaction is a trade that settles on any date other than the standard settlement date (T+2).

6. **Regular Way Trade**: However, being a regular way trade (a trade that settles on the standard settlement date) is not a reason to mark an order ticket short exempt.

** A **non-regular way transaction** is a trade that settles on any date other than the standard settlement date (T+2). While a non-regular way transaction can be a reason for marking an order ticket short exempt, not all short exempt orders are non-regular way transactions.

** The "short exempt" designation primarily indicates that the order is exempt from the uptick rule, which is a rule that restricts short sales to shares that are increasing in price. This exemption can be applied under certain conditions, such as during a riskless principal trade or a non-regular way transaction.

** So, a short exempt order could potentially settle on T+2 (a regular way transaction) or on a different date (a non-regular way transaction), depending on the specific circumstances of the trade.
** The modifier used for short-exempt orders is typically marked as “SE” on the order ticket.
* Upstrick rule:
** Key takeaway from the uptick rule:
** If a stock’s price declines 10% from the prior day’s close,
*** no short sales may be executed in that stock for the remainder of that day or the next trading day.
** An exception is available for short sales above the national best bid (NBB),
*** which can be executed and marked short exempt.
* Halts
** Single-Stock Trading Pause (8% Rule):
This is a short-term trading halt in a single security. If a stock's price moves 10 percent or more within a five-minute period, trading is halted for five minutes. This rule applies to stocks in the S&P 500 Index, Russell 1000 Index, and certain exchange-traded products.

** Circuit Breakers (7%, 13%, 20% Rules):
These are market-wide trading halts that occur when the whole market declines by a certain percentage in a single day. The levels are set by the SEC and are based on the previous day's closing price of the S&P 500 Index:
- **Level 1 Halt (7% decline)**: A drop of 7% from the previous day's closing price of the S&P 500 triggers a 15-minute trading halt. Trading is not halted if the drop occurs at or after 3:25 p.m.
- **Level 2 Halt (13% decline)**: A drop of 13% triggers a 15-minute halt. Trading is not halted if the drop occurs at or after 3:25 p.m.
- **Level 3 Halt (20% decline)**: A drop of 20% triggers a halt for the rest of the trading day.

** News Pending Halts:
Trading can also be halted on a security due to pending news, either by the exchange or by the listed company itself. This is done to prevent trading on asymmetric information.

** Order Imbalance Halts:
Exchanges can halt trading temporarily to replenish liquidity in a stock if there is a significant imbalance between buy and sell orders.

** Regulatory Halts:
The SEC can halt trading in any stock for up to 10 days (can be extended for 90 days) if it believes that the public interest and the protection of investors require a suspension of trading.

** short sale circuit breaker
*** only applies during normal market hours (9:30 am–4:00 pm).
a) Example: XYZ’s price declines 12% on Tuesday.
   For the remainder of Tuesday and all-day Wednesday,
   XYZ may not be sold short unless the sale occurs at a price higher than the NBB.
*** Under Reg SHO, if a stock falls by 10% on Monday
and then an additional on Tuesday, the short sale price restriction will apply to Wednesday’s
trading day and be lifted at the close of business on Wednesday (unless the
price also falls by 10% on Wednesday, in which case it would be further
extended).
*** alternative upstick rule:
trading allowed for price above NBB (best bid)
** Under Reg NMS Rule 611 (The Trade-Through Rule) it is prohibited to execute
trades at prices inferior to protected quotations.
** An exception from the Order Protection Rule means an order can be
executed at a price that is inferior to, or not executed against (i.e., tradedthrough), a better price on another exchange. Exceptions from the Order
Protection Rule include the second leg of a riskless principal trade, qualified
contingent trades, crossed market trades, self-help (described below), and
ISO orders.
** A broker-dealer or an exchange raises a “self-help” alert when another
broker-dealer or exchange is experiencing a technical problem and should
be bypassed when routing orders.
a) For example, Broker-Dealer X could raise a self-help against BrokerDealer Z when Broker-Dealer Z is having a technical problem.
Broker-Dealer X would then route orders elsewhere. Self-help is also
usually claimed if a market center does not respond to orders within
one second.
b) Once the “self-help” flag is raised, a BD or exchange can trade
through the protected quotes on the exchange experiencing
difficulties and would not violate the trade through rules.
c) When a market maker claims self-help, it must notify the market
center with the issue that its quotes will not be protected.
** The exam may reference a benchmark trade. It is not an exception to the
trade-through rule. A benchmark trade is an order executed at a price that
is not based on the then-current quoted price—benchmark trades are very
specific types of orders only permitted in connection with a pilot program
on small-cap stocks (Rule 608 of Reg NMS). This type of trade should be
selected as an answer only if all these characteristics are indicated. In all
other cases, benchmark trade will not be the correct answer.
** If a Level 3 Market Decline (20%) occurs at any time during the trading day,
FINRA shall halt trading for the remainder of the trading day. Trading will
resume at the open the next market day.
** If a Level 3 trading halt stopped trading for the rest of the day all MOC
orders are cancelled. The Official Closing Price is the last trade executed
before the halt.
** To calculate the Level 3 (20% decline) trading halt against the prior day’s
close, if only given today’s opening price which is 10% down from
yesterday’s close, do the following:
a) Assume today’s opening price is $1,800.
b) Calculate yesterday’s close (divide by .9)
i. $1,800 / (1 – 10%)
ii. $1,800/(0.90) = $2,000
c) Calculate a 20% decline (multiply by .8)
i. $2,000 x (1- 20%) =
ii. $2,000 x (0.80) = $1,600
d) If the market drops to $1,600 (a 20% decline against yesterday’s
$2,000 close) it will trigger a Level 3 trading halt for the rest of the
day.
** The SEC can halt all trading on any exchange for 90 calendar days with
notice to the President of the United States.
** FINRA can halt OTC trading for an extraordinary event for up to 10 business
days. After 10 days FINRA must confirm that the extraordinary event is
ongoing in order to extend the halt.
** SEC Market Access rules (15c3-5) require firms have risk management
controls and supervisory procedures that prevent market access customers
from entering orders that exceed appropriate pre-set credit or capital
thresholds.
** During normal market hours, any trade in an NMS stock with a price greater than $50 outside a 3% band from the reference price will be deemed clearly erroneous.
** A member must submit a written complaint about a clearly erroneous trade within 30 minutes of the execution time.
** OTC transactions (third market) that are clearly erroneous are addressed by FINRA's Market Regulation Department, not NASDAQ. If clearly erroneous,FINRA may declare a trade null and void.
** FINRA anti-money laundering rules require that the person designated as the AML compliance person must be an associated person of the brokerdealer. It cannot be delegated to another firm.
** Financial risk management controls prevent the entry of erroneous orders,such as duplicative orders or orders that exceed appropriate price or size parameters.
*** These are distinct from a firm’s regulatory risk management (which deals with regulation compliance) and credit risk management (which deals with the extension of credit).
** Risk management controls cannot be designated or delegated to a thirdparty or outside vendor.
** A firm’s CEO must certify the effectiveness of a firm’s controls.
** Firms should have pre-trade controls (a type of risk management control) in place to prevent “fat finger” errors – e.g., entering extra zeroes or duplicate orders.
*** Pre-trade controls will screen orders prior to entry to prevent duplicates, unusual dollar amounts and size, and a price too far from the current market price.
** A firm using automated trading systems must also use automated pre-trade controls.
** A firm must take into account its trades during the day to determine if it is long or short in a security.
*** For example, BD A begins the day long 2,000 shares of ABC Corp. During the day it enters three orders: Sell 1,500, Buy 500, Sell 500.
*** Based off the three trades it is still long 1,500 shares at the end of the day because the two trades in the middle netted out to zero.
* LULD
** The purpose of limit up/limit down (LULD) is to prevent extraordinary volatility in National Market System (NMS) stocks.
** For Limit-Up Limit-Down, price limits are 5% for S&P 500 and Russell 1,000 stocks and 10% for all other NMS stocks.
** Under limit-up limit-down, a security is in a straddle state if the bid and offer are on either side of the price band.
For example, a quote of 103-105 with an upper price band of 104 would be a straddle state.
Under a straddle state, the exchange will monitor conditions and implement a pause for anything abnormal.
Note that in this example 104-105 would be a limit state and there would be an automatic pause if the limit state persists for 15 seconds.
** If a security enters a limit up-limit down (LULD) trading halt within the last 5 minutes of the trading day, the next opportunity to trade that security would be the closing cross.
The closing cross will end the pause and set the closing price for the security.
** What happens in a 15-second limit state?
a. No new reference prices or price bands are calculated.
b. Trading continues within the price bands.
c. The stock can exit a limit state when the entire size of all limit state quotes is cancelled or executed during the 15 seconds.
d. If the quote remains at or outside the band for 15 seconds, a five minute pause is triggered by the primary listing exchange.
#+title: Chapter 4: Handling Customer Orders
* Order Types
Market orders are executed immediately upon receipt.
Limit orders are executed only when the specified limit price is available and then in price/time priority.
Marketable limit orders are limit orders than can be filled immediately given the current market price.
For example, a buy limit at $10.50 when the best offer is $10.40 is marketable.
* A client choosing to “hit the bid” is saying they want to place a market order to sell. Conversely, “lifting the offer” is a market order to buy
* If an investor places a limit order that specifies that they want a certain price, including the commission, the broker-dealer most protect the order at a better price of its choosing so that the all-in price to the customer does not exceed the customer’s specifications. For example, if a customer says, “I want to pay no more than $30, including the commission,” the brokerdealer might choose to protect the order at $29, thereby allowing room for a $1 commission. This must be clearly explained to the customer.
* Buy limit and sell stop orders are entered at or below the current market price. Sell limit and buy stop orders are entered at or above the current market price.
* For cash dividends, orders entered at or below the market are reduced on the ex-dividend date – this includes buy limit and sell stop orders.
** Dividends for fractional cents are rounded up to adjust orders. For example,a dividend for 37.25 cents would be treated as a 38-cent dividend and orders would be adjusted downward by 38 cents.
* Nasdaq system hours are 4am – 8pm.
** Customers wishing to engage in extended hours trading must receive a risk disclosure document which highlights the following after-hours trading risk factors:
*** lack of liquidity, high volatility, unlinked markets, effect of news and wider spreads.
* In a stock split both the number of shares and the share price are adjusted.
a. Example: A 3:2 split (you own 100 shares at $24)
The number of shares is multiple by 3, then divided by 2 (the new
share count is 100 x 3 / 2 = 150 shares)
The share price is multiplied by 2, then divided by 3 (the new price is
$24 x 2 / 3 = $16)
* A marking-the-close violation occurs if trades are placed with the intent to artificially affect the closing price.
* Collusion is a manipulative and prohibited practice where traders coordinate prices or the bid–ask spread. This goes well beyond negotiating trade prices (which is allowed).
* Layering is a form of market manipulation where investors enter limit orders with the intended effect of moving the market to obtain a beneficial execution on the other side of the market.
* Interpositioning is the prohibited practice of introducing additional parties to a securities transaction to generate additional commissions. If the introduction of the additional party results in a superior price (not equal, but better) then it is allowed.
* Traders who act together to manipulate prices, often by creating an artificial appearance of supply or demand, are said to be “painting the tape” or participating in a stock pool.
** Painting the tape can inflate trading volume, manipulate the stock price, or both.
* Self-trades are transactions where both sides originate with the same firm.
** Broker-dealers must have procedures in place to review and prevent a pattern of self-trades.
** Assuming procedures are in place, a self-trade is not a violation if it was unintentional.
** For example,
*** if the trade occurred between legitimately distinct trading desks and was not done merely to create the illusion of activity in a security, it would not be a violation.
* Quote stuffing is a prohibited practice where algorithmic traders enter and then quickly withdraw large orders for the purpose of creating confusion in the market and taking advantage of trading opportunities.
* A trader is allowed to split an order for a valid reason, such as faster execution, but trade shredding to generate additional commissions is prohibited.
* Spoofing refers to entering orders to entice other participants to join on the same side of the market at a price at which they would not ordinarily trade, and then trading against the other market participants' orders.
* Front running block transactions (generally a transaction involving 10,000 shares or more) is prohibited.
** The rule has several exceptions, including:
a. No-knowledge of the block pending block trade (i.e., information barriers),
b. Transactions to fill prior customer orders,
c. Transactions to correct bona fide errors,
d. Transactions to offset odd-lot orders, or
e. Transactions in compliance with the marketplace rules of a national securities exchange
** It is a front running violation to trade based on advance knowledge of an imminent block transaction. Even if part of the block has already been executed, the entire order must be filled and publicly reported to avoid triggering a violation.
* Tweeting newsworthy information as a means of public dissemination is not a violation as long as the information is accurate.
** However, if a CEO tweets newsworthy information about a company that is not factually accurate and which causes the stock to rise, this would be considered manipulative and deceptive.
* Investors may face wide spreads (a large difference between the bid and the ask) if they
1) trade outside of normal market hours or
2) trade penny stocks.
* An order ticket must specifically note whether an order was entered as a discretionary or an unsolicited order. It is a violation to inappropriately mark a solicited trade as unsolicited or discretionary.** The order ticket must include the time of execution, whereas the trade confirmation may, but is not required to.
* Order receipt time is not required on a trade confirmation.
* Trade confirmations must indicate whether the broker-dealer received payment for order flow for the transaction.
*** The specific source and nature of the payment for order flow are furnished only upon the customer’s written request.
* CUSIP numbers are found on a trade confirmation, but not on the order ticket.
** The trade confirmation will include if the trade was executed as principal or agent.
* The time of entry is defined as the time when the firm transmits the order or instruction for execution.
* There are three types of pegged orders:
** primary peg,
** market peg, and
** midpoint peg.
** Any order with a limit price is not necessarily a pegged order.
** A pegged order is a special type of limit order that automatically adjusts as the market moves.
* If a firm trades for its own account to execute a customer’s order as a riskless principal trade, this does not trigger a manning order obligation under the limit order protection rule. This is also referred to as executing a facilitated order.
** A customer’s limit order is not required to be displayed under certain circumstances.
Important exceptions include
1) if the customer requests their order not be displayed,
2) the customer’s size represents a de minimis change in the market maker’s size (defined as no more than 10% of the market maker’s displayed quote size), and
3) odd-lot orders.
* A market maker is not required to display a customer all-or-none (AON) limit order.
* When determining an equity mark-up or mark-down,
** a firm would not consider its own cost (or basis) in the security; instead, the firm should look to the current market price.
* The 5% policy is different for debt securities.
** For debt securities, the mark-up or mark-down should first reflect the prevailing market price, which is established by the firm’s contemporaneous cost or proceeds.

* The FINRA 5% policy is a guideline, NOT a rule. There are cases where a higher than 5% fee may be justified.
* For NMS stocks trading for $1.00 or more, the minimum price improvement is one penny.
** For example,
*** the smallest price improvement available to a bid of $12.30 is one cent, making the bid $12.31.A bid of $12.305 is not permissible.
** The smallest price improvement available for an offer of $12.35 is $12.34 (down one cent); a quote of $12.345 is not permitted.
* For trade reporting purposes, a riskless principal transaction is treated as one trade.
** For example, if a broker-dealer purchases 50,000 shares of stock to fill an existing customer order for 50,000 shares, this would be reported as one transaction for 50,000 total shares. It would not be reported as two transactions for 100,000 total shares.
* After a reverse stock split, all open orders are cancelled.
* Securities, such as stocks and bonds, are typically deposited with a clearing house.
* A firm dually registered as a broker-dealer and investment adviser
is more likely to fill customer orders in an agency capacity rather than as aprincipal.
* Displayed orders have priority over non-displayed orders at the same price.
* Displayed shares have priority over reserve shares at the same price.
** For example:
*** MM AA is displaying 4 round lots to buy at $10.00 and has a 2 round lots of reserve at $10.00.
*** MM BB is also displaying 2 round lots to buy at $10.00.
*** If a customer order is received to sell 6 round lots,
**** the 4 round lots being displayed by MM AA and
**** the 2 round lots being displayed by MM BB will be executed against,
**** while the reserve quote would not be.
* When a re-organized company emerges from bankruptcy with an IPO,
** the newly issued shares will generally trade when-issued with a “v” symbol at the end of the ticker.
** Once the shares a formally issued, the “v” symbol is removed.
#+title: =============================== Chapter 5: Trade Reporting ====================================
* Stop stock orders (i.e., the customer is promised a price for a short period of time) are allowed only for customer orders.
** They do not require exchange or regulator permission.
* If a broker-dealer receives a customer buy order for a security
** and simultaneously purchases that stock for its own account to fill the
** customer’s order from its own inventory, the trade report would be marked
** as “riskless principal”.
* A trade report will identify whether a trade was a long sale or short sale.
Note that there is not a specific trade modifier used to identify a short sale.
* A trade report is marked as/of when the trade occurred earlier than the
current day (e.g., yesterday) or when reporting the reversal of a trade from
a previous day.
* Important TRF modifiers:
a. “.T” indicates a timely report for a trade executed outside market
hours. Timely reports are due within 10 seconds of execution when
TRF is open; if TRF is closed, by 8:15 a.m. the next time TRF is open.
b. “.Z” indicates a late report for a trade executed during normal
market hours trade (9:30 a.m. – 4:00 p.m.). Late is defined as more
than 10 seconds after execution. Note: a trade executed during
market hours (e.g., 3:40 p.m.) but report late after the market closes
(e.g., 4:15 p.m.) should carry a .Z modifier because the execution
was during market hours.
c. “.P” indicates a Prior Reference Price trade. A trade report with a .P
modifier will include both the actual executed time and the
reference time. The price reported will be the actual executed
price.
i. Example: Client places an order to buy stock at 11:00 AM. At
**30 AM the trader realizes that the order was not executed.
The trade can be executed at the 11:00 AM price with a .P
modifier indicating both times.
* Unless there is an exemption from trade reporting requirements, an ATS must
report trades to the TRF or ORF within 10 seconds of execution.
** A “give-up” agreement allows one member to allow another member to
report and lock-in trades on its behalf.
** Certain transactions are exempt from trade reporting requirements:
a. Transactions that are part of a new issue.
b. Transactions where the buyer and seller have agreed to a price
unrelated to the current market price (e.g., a gift)
i. Note that these are reported for the purpose of regulatory
fee assessments but not for publication and dissemination.
c. Transactions related to the exercise of a derivative at a price
unrelated to the market value.
i. Note that these are reported for the purpose of regulatory
fee assessments but not for publication and dissemination.
d. Tender offer transactions
** FINRA considers several factors for consequences for late trading
reporting – including the trade complexity.
**If a firm’s primary reporting facility is having an outage the firm may
continue to trade provided that it can report to a secondary facility.
Alternatively, firms may stop executing until the problem is resolved or can
route orders to another exchange or FINRA facility that is able to
effectively report trades.
* Chapter 6: New-Issue Market
** Insiders (e.g., CEO, CFO, and board members) will often agree to a postIPO lock-up with their underwriter. Though not required, lock-ups typically
last 180 days.
** When selling IPOs, firms might choose to allocate shares to “friends and
family” through a Directed Share Program.
** Flipping is when an investor sells shares acquired in an IPO within 30 days of
the offering date. The 30-day period is measured from the offering date
regardless of when the purchaser was allocated or paid for the shares.
** A green shoe clause in an underwriting agreement permits the underwriting
investment bank to increase the size of the deal by up to 15% to meet
investor demand.
** A security that is the subject of an IPO must first open for trading on the
primary exchange (e.g., NYSE), before it can begin trading elsewhere. Note
that there is an exception where after the distribution of shares a stock can
trade OTC until midnight the day prior to the IPO.
** Prior to an IPO, orders to purchase the stock are permitted, but they must
be limit orders. Not held and market (sometimes referred to as held) orders
are not allowed. For example, a held sell order, a held limit buy order, and
a held limit sell order would all be permitted pre-IPO (since they are either
sell orders or buy orders that specify a price). A held buy order is not
allowed, because there is no price.
** In an IPO, a market maker can buy or sell stock in the secondary market
after the first trade on the primary exchange. Once a new security is priced,
the underwriters will sell the new issue at the public offering price (POP) to
investors (e.g., at $11.00 per share). The initial transaction after the IPO
(typically the next morning) will occur on Nasdaq or NYSE at the market
price, which could be higher or lower than the IPO price.
** A broker-dealer that is not part of an IPO can execute customer orders for
the new shares on the effective date after the market opens. A marketmaking firm can register and immediately begin quoting an IPO after its
opening IPO cross.
** In a partial tender, exercised call options are included as part of an
investor’s long position. If an investor exercises call options, those shares can
be tendered, even if the tender closes that night.
** A Dutch auction tender offer is an auction where all winning bidders pay
the same price. In a Dutch auction, all orders are filled at the clearing price.
The clearing price is determined based on the price at which all shares can
be filled.
** If a Dutch auction is oversubscribed, orders are filled pro rata – meaning
everyone gets the same percentage of the shares they wanted to
purchase.
** Under Rule 10b-18, a company can repurchase up to 25% of its average
daily trading volume (ADTV) in a particular day. Note that the ADTV is
based on the average of the past four weeks.
** Summary of Rule 144:
a. Control stock is subject to a volume restriction. This amount can be
calculated and then sold once every 90 days.
b. Control stock is not subject to a six-month holding period.
c. Restricted stock is subject to a six-month holding period, but not a
volume restriction.
** Rule 144A permits Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) to purchase
unregistered securities. (Note: Rule 144 is different than Rule 144A).
** Market makers may not collude to keep a stock’s price at a particular level.
However, an underwriting syndicate may act together to support a new
issue by having one firm, on behalf of the syndicate, place a stabilizing bid.
** If an underwriter initiates stabilization when the market is closed, the
maximum stabilization bid is the prior closing price. For example, an IPO
opens at $40.00 per share and closes that day at $39.45. The maximum
price a stabilizing bid may be entered for the next day is $39.45.
** An underwriter can never stabilize above the IPO price.
** Only one syndicate member may stabilize, but a stabilization bid can
remain outstanding indefinitely and a stabilization agent is permitted to
purchase an unlimited number of shares.
** Make sure to review the restricted periods under Regulation M:
a. For the smallest companies (no criteria to meet), the restricted
period begins 5 business days before pricing.
b. For medium-sized companies, the restricted period begins 1
business day before pricing. These are defined as companies that
have an ADTV (average daily trading volume) of at least $100,000
and a public float of at least $25 million.
c. Actively traded companies (large companies) have no restricted
period. Actively trades companies are those that have an ADTV of
at least $1 million and a public float of at least $150 million.
** During the Regulation M restricted period, distribution participants (i.e.,
underwriters) can choose to be passive market makers or can seek an
excused withdrawal.
** Under Regulation M Rule 103, the maximum bid for a passive market maker
is the highest independent bid, which is the highest bid by a market maker
that is not also an underwriter.
** MMAA is a passive market maker. If MMBB has entered the highest
independent bid, e.g., at $10.00, and then lowers its bid to $9.75, MMAA
can purchase two times the minimum quotation size (typically 200 shares)
at the $10.00 price and then must lower its price to $9.75.
** An exception to Regulation M’s Rule 105 (short-sale rule) allows bona fide
investors who meet certain conditions to short sell within the five-day
restricted period and close their positions with newly offered shares. To use
the exception, the latest a short sale trade can occur is 30 minutes prior to
the close on the business day prior to the day of pricing. It is more important
to know the latest time the short sale can occur than the other conditions
required to use this rule.
** Public companies are required to disclose quantitative and qualitative
information on SEC filings. Regulation SK governs the release of nonfinancial information while Regulation SX governs the release of financial
information.
* Chapter 7: Equity Markets Securities Regulations
** It is a violation of the suitability rules to email all of one’s clients with the
same recommendation. This is not a know-your-customer (KYC) violation.
a. Suitability focuses on whether there is a reasonable basis to believe
that a recommended transaction or investment strategy is
appropriate for the customer.
b. KYC focuses on knowing the “essential facts” concerning each
customer account, e.g., the customer’s identity, background,
investment history, and sources of investable funds.
** “Trading ahead” is the prohibited practice of trading securities based on
non-public advance knowledge of the content of an upcoming research
report. Traders that come into possession of such information may not trade
on that information.
a) Note, if the event causing a change in a pending research report is
public (e.g., there is widely reported news that a company has lost
a major client or gov’t contract) a trader could inform a client of
the public news but must remain silent as to any pending change in
the research coverage.
** Regulation NMS Rules 605 and 606 require uniform information on where
customer orders are being routed and the quality of execution being
received. Candidates should know both the content of the rules and the
rule numbers.
** Reg NMS Rule 605 requires monthly reports by market centers.
** Reg NMS Rule 606 reports do not include directed orders, since those orders
are filled through the venue of a customer’s choosing.
** Under Regulation BI, Form CRS must be presented to a customer at the time
of, or prior to, making a recommendation, placing an order or opening an
account.
** Large traders must identify themselves using a Form 13H. However, “inactive
status” is available for large traders who did not cross the large trader
threshold at any time during the previous full calendar year. Once inactive,
a large trader need not file Form 13H unless and until its transactions are
equal to or greater than the threshold level.
** If an institutional client suggests a trade which would take the client over
their credit limit at that broker-dealer, the registered representative should
talk to their supervisor about increasing the limit.
** For NMS stocks under the ’34 Act, a Qualified Block positioner trades blocks
of stock with a current market value of $200,000 or more in a single trade or
several transactions at approximately the same time to facilitate a sale or
purchase by a customer.
a) A block is defined differently under FINRA’s OTC rules, where a block
is defined as 10,000 shares and $100,000 in value.
b) Qualified block positioners must maintain minimum net capital of $1
million.
**A penny stock is an OTC equity worth less than $5.00 per share. Some rules
relating to penny stocks are below.
a) When a penny stock is trade is solicited, the registered rep must
disclose the current quote and compensation to be received by
the rep and the firm. Note that the number of market makers
making a market in the security is not required to be disclosed.
b) The client must sign and return a penny stock risk disclosure
document prior to their firm penny stock trade.
c) The client must sign a suitability statement before each penny stock
trade until they become an “established” customer (meaning they
have done at least three penny stock trades with that firm on three
separate days, or they have had an account for at least one year.
Exemptions from the suitability statement include:
i.Unsolicited orders
ii.Institutional accounts
iii.Firms who receive less than 5% of their commission revenue
from penny stock trades.
**As noted above, penny stocks are generally defined as OTC equities
worth less than $5 per share. However, companies with any of the
following financial statistics are not penny stocks: net tangible assets of at
least $2mm (or $5mm if in business less than three years) or average
revenue of at least $6mm for the last three years.
**Customers who own penny stocks must receive monthly account
statements, which include the number of shares and estimated market
value of each penny stock held in the account. The estimated market
value is calculated as follows:
a) It is estimated as the highest bid on the last day of the statement
period multiplied by the number of shares owned by the customer.
b) If the stock is not currently being quoted, it is estimated as the
weighted average price per share paid by the broker-dealer during
the final five trading days of the statement period multiplied by the
number of shares owned by the customer.
c) If neither of the above options are available, then no estimated
market value is shown on the account statement.
**Regulation FD requires firms to disclose sensitive information simultaneously
with their intentional disclosure to research analysts. Accidental disclosure
of sensitive information requires public disclosure by the later of 24 hours or
the open of trading the next business day.
* Chapter 8: Options Contracts and Strategies
** OTC options are created individually between two counterparties. The key
difference between OTC and exchange-listed options is that OTC options
have counterparty risk.
** CBOE floor brokers are individuals on the exchange floor who accept and
execute orders from registered broker-dealers and Trading Permit Holders.
They cannot accept orders from any other source.
** To find the breakeven, use the strategy of “call up, put down.” For calls,
add the net premium to the strike price of the dominant position—call up.
For puts, subtract the net premium from the strike price of the dominant
position—put down.
** When asked to find the maximum gain (i.e., maximum revenue) or
maximum loss, always include the premiums in the calculation. Note that
premiums are still considered even if the question asks one to exclude fees.
The premium is not a fee—it is the market price of the option.
** Key items regarding covered calls:
a. The position is created by owning the stock and selling a call
against those shares.
b. Max Gain = Strike Price − Stock Purchase Price + Premium Received
** The type of spread is determined by the contract feature that is different.
Series 57 Key Concepts
Version: 2022 V11 22
a. If the strike prices are different, but the expiration months are the
same, the spread is a “vertical” or “price” spread.
b. If the strike prices are the same, but the expiration months are
different, the spread is a “horizontal” or “calendar” spread.
c. If both the strike prices and the expiration months are different, the
spread is a “diagonal” spread.
** An investor with a debit call spread will incur a loss of the aggregate
premiums if both options expire.
** Investors who establish debit call spreads are moderately bullish because
they limit their potential upside to make the position less costly. They give up
any profit above the strike price of the short call.
** A bear call spread is established with two positions:
** Selling a call with a low strike price, and
** Buying a call with a higher strike price
It is also referred to as a “credit call spread.” The market view of this position
is bearish.
** A put spread is 1) bearish and 2) a debit when the investor purchases a put
contract with a higher strike price and sells a put contract with a lower strike
price.
** A trick to remember whether an investor hopes for a spread to widen or
narrow is to look at the number of letters in the words:
a. Debit spreads widen: “Debit” has five letters; “widen” has five
letters.
b. Credit spreads narrow: “Credit” has six letters; “narrow” has six
letters.
** In a spread, the dominant position is always the position with the higher
premium. It indicates whether the spread is bullish or bearish and is also
used to find the breakeven point.
** A long straddle is created by simultaneously buying a call and buying a put
on the same security with the same strike price. A short straddle would be
created by selling a call and selling a put.
** If an investor enters a straddle (long or short) with options that have
different strike prices—e.g., a higher call strike and a lower put strike, or vice
versa—the position is called a “strangle” or a “combination.” A long or short
combination has the exact same attitude as a long or short straddle. For
example, a long combination, like a long straddle, speculates that the
stock will be volatile.
Series 57 Key Concepts
Version: 2022 V11 23
** If an investor believes a stock will trade with volatility but is not sure of the
direction, the investor should open a long straddle on the position.
** An investor who expects little volatility (i.e., flat markets) should enter into a
short straddle position (short call and short put). A short combination, similar
to a straddle, would also achieve the same effect.
** Index options are always settled for cash.
** VIX index options allow investors to speculate on investor sentiment and
market volatility. Importantly, the VIX index is inverse to the market; so, as
the market rises, the VIX falls. When the market falls, the VIX rises. Described
differently, a bearish investor would purchase VIX calls.
** A butterfly spread is made of four options, all with the same expiration,
three with different strike prices. A two-option position could not be a
butterfly spread.
** A butterfly spread has two contracts on the outside and two contracts in
the middle – e.g., Buy 1 40 call, Sell 2 50 calls, Buy 1 60 call. Described
differently, it is a 1-2-1 position, NOT a 2-1-2 position.
** Review what options are American and European style:
a. American options: Most exchange-traded equity (stock and ETF)
options
b. European options: Most exchange-traded index options, such as
SPX (S&P 500 index) and VIX index options, as well as foreign
currency options.
** The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is a federal law that
protects private sector retirement plans such as 401(k) Plans. Importantly,
an ERISA plan is permitted to trade options as long as it meets the
investment criteria of the plan.
** Options can be exercised up until 5:30pm et on the third Friday of the
expiration month. An investor who owns an out-of-the-money option at this
time will let it expire.
** The CBOE’s position limits rule governs how many options contracts an
investor may control. Exceptions to the standard position limits are available
for 1) delta hedging, 2) firm facilitation, or 3) market-making.
Note: there is not an exception to position limits based on dividends. It is
more important to know the names of the exemptions – and what is not an
exemption - as opposed to their application or use.
** Position limits on the same side of the market are aggregated. For example,
**000 long calls and 4,000 short puts are aggregated as a 9,000 position
(since they are both bullish). On the other hand, 3,000 long calls and 3,000
Series 57 Key Concepts
Version: 2022 V11 24
long puts would be two separate 3,000 positions since one is bullish and one
is bearish.
** OPRA (the Options Price Reporting Authority) collects, consolidates, and
disseminates options market data (last sale and quotes) from options
exchanges. Think of OPRA as the reporting facility for options transactions,
similar to the consolidated tape or TRF.
** To take advantage of a strong foreign economy, an investor can buy calls
in that currency. For example, if the French economy looks strong and
France has falling unemployment, an investor should buy EUR calls. If a
foreign economy is weakening, an investor should buy puts on that
currency.
** Here are some key points regarding stock splits:
a. The value of an option contract remains the same if the underlying
stock splits. For example, the value of an option contract is $500; the
underlying equity has a 5:4 stock split, so the option’s value remains
the same at $500.
b. For an odd stock split, the contract size will be adjusted. For
example, in a 3:2 split, the options contracts on that underlying
equity will be adjusted. The number of shares per contract increases
by 3/2 (to 150 shares per contract) and the strike price is adjusted
downwards by 2/3. Note the premium on the option contract
doesn’t change.
** Standard options contracts may not be purchased on margin. Therefore, a
customer buying two options contracts at 14 would need to have at least
$2,800 in her account ($14.00 per Share × 100 Shares × 2 Contracts =
$2,800).
If the customer had more than $2,800 in cash in her account, no deposit
would be required to make the purchase. This funding could be obtained
by transfer from a cash account into the margin account.
** Foreign currency options have a contract size of 10,000 units of currency
(i.e., 10,000 pounds, Euros, or Canadian dollars).
The exception is Japanese yen. Options denominated in Japanese yen
have a contract size of 1,000,000 yen.
** If a market maker holds a customer all-or-none (AON) buy order and
receives a sell order that is not for enough shares, the market maker will not
execute the customer’s AON order. For example, if a customer enters a buy
**hares AON order and, subsequently, a market order to sell 300 is
Series 57 Key Concepts
Version: 2022 V11 25
received, the AON order is not executed. The same concept applies to
options trades.
** A facilitation cross is when a floor broker holds a customer order and a
contra-side order, the broker can cross the two orders only after checking
the market for a better price and allowing other market participants to
execute the trade on the same price and terms. This is most common for
options.
** Not held orders permit floor brokers to decide the time and price at which
to execute a customer’s order. All orders given to floor brokers are defined
as not held orders unless otherwise specified. A not held order does not give
discretion over the specific security or quantity.
** When an option is exercised, the OCC assigns an exercise notice to a
broker-dealer using random selection. A broker-dealer will then assign
delivery to a customer who is short the equivalent position using random
selection, first-in first-out or any other fair and equitable method.
** Index options can be purchased in an ERISA sponsored plan provided they
conform with the plan’s investment policy and that no margin is required
(since ERISA accounts must be cash accounts). For example, selling
uncovered calls requires a margin deposit and therefore would be
prohibited.Key Topics






* buy limit and sell stop orders:

** Buy Limit Order:
*** This is an order to purchase a security at or below a specified price.
*** For example,
**** if a stock is currently trading at $50, you could place a buy limit order at $45.
**** This means you want to buy the stock, but only if you can get it for $45 or less.

** Sell Stop Order:
*** This is an order to sell a security when it reaches a certain price.
*** For example,
**** if a stock is currently trading at $50, you could place a sell stop order at $45.
**** This means you want to sell the stock if its price drops to $45 or lower.

** On the ex-dividend date, the price of the stock will typically drop by approximately the amount of the dividend.
** This is because the value of the company (and therefore the theoretical value of the stock) decreases by the amount of the dividend paid out.

** So, if you have a buy limit order or a sell stop order in place, these orders are **reduced** by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date.
** This is to reflect the decrease in the stock's price due to the dividend payout.

** For example,
*** if you have a buy limit order for a stock at $50, and the company pays a $1 dividend, your buy limit order would be reduced to $49 on the ex-dividend date.
*** Similarly, if you have a sell stop order at $50, it would be reduced to $49.

** This adjustment helps to ensure that your orders are executed in line with your original investment intentions, taking into account the impact of the dividend payout.
