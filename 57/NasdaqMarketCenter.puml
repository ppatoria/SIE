** **Levels of Service**

*** **Level 1 Service (Nasdaq Basic):**
**** provides information on the best bids and offers on all US exchange-listed securities traded on Nasdaq.
**** provides information regarding the last sale (last match) for each security as reported to the FINRA/Nasdaq Trade Reporting Facility.
**** It is appropriate for retail investors or financial professionals not directly executing trades or \nrequiring detailed market data, as it provides a limited view of the market.


**** Example:\n__**SHARES BID ASK SHARES**__\n1,300 14.10 14.15 500


*** **Level 2 Service:**
**** provides all the data available in Level 1 plus market participant depth in Nasdaq, NYSE, \nand regional exchange-listed securities.
**** Market participant depth shows the best quote of each market participant in the Nasdaq execution system \n(not just the highest bid and lowest ask).
**** This type of data can be used by market participants to gauge supply, demand, and \npotential market movements as a result of liquidity or lack thereof.

*** **Nasdaq TotalView:**
**** Displays every quote and order at every price level \nin Nasdaq-, NYSE-, NYSE MKT-, and regional-listed securities on Nasdaq.
**** Unlike Level 2, TotalView shows the quotes for all displayable orders in the Nasdaq execution system.
**** a TotalView subscriber would see all of the quotes from a market maker at all price levels, \nnot just each market makerâ€™s best price.
**** TotalView includes Net Order Imbalance Indicator (NOII) data for the Nasdaq opening and closing crosses \nthat can be used to participate in the market opening and closing.

*** **Level 3 Service (Required for Market Makers):**
**** It is required for market makers.
**** Displays all the data from TotalView, and allows a market maker to adjust its quotes in the system, \nproviding the mechanism to change quotes as investors change their view of a particular security.
**** The quotes that are displayed on Level 1, Level 2, and TotalView are entered and modified by market maker firms \nthat have subscribed to Level 3 service.
**** Allows firms to see the entire depth of the market.
