* Fixed-rate capital securities [important]
are a type of *hybrid security* that have characteristics of both
- bonds and
- preferred stock.
Corporations issue them and have a
- fixed interest rate, but
- do not have a stated maturity date. Instead,
- they have a call date,
which is the earliest date that the issuer can redeem the security.

Because of this call feature,
- fixed-rate capital securities are typically traded based on their average life,
  which takes into account the call date and expected cash flows.

*** sinking fund provision  - common in bonds with long-term maturity  - is the provision by the issuer to prepare for future redemption (interest payments).  - issuer establishes an escrow account<\b> with the bank (or any third party)  - issuer regularly sets aside money in the special account called a sinking fund to redeem bonds before maturity.
** bonds types
*'********
*** coupon bonds
**** fixed rate bonds
****  floating or variable rate or adjustable rate bonds
***** Interest rates are based on specific benchmarks like treasury bill rates.
***** Example: The ray may be treasury bills + 2%
***** market value of such bonds is stable.
*** zero-coupon bonds
**** purchased at a deep discount
****  Note: Zero-coupon bonds do pay interest but only at maturity. The interest is the difference between the discounted issue price and the par or maturity value.
**** useful for long-term goals such as retirement or a college education
**** taxed on imputed or phantom interest
***** investor pays tax each year on the imputed interest
***** imputed interest = yield to maturity * present price
** yield
*'*********
*** types
**** NY (nominal yield or coupon)
***** fixed interest rate
**** CY (current yield)
***** yield in the current market
***** CY = annual interest / current market price of the bond
**** YTC (yield to call)
**** YTM (yield to maturity)
*** relationship
**** when the bond is trading at premium  NY > CY > YTM > YTC
**** when the bond is trading at a discount NY < CY < YTM < YTC
**** when bond is trading at par      NY = CY = YTM = YTC
** bond pricing
*'****************
*** Price is inversely proportional to interest rates.
*** basis points (bps): unit of measurement. 100bps = 1%  75 bps =  0.75%
** call feature
*'****************
*** callable bonds
**** issuer must clearly state
***** - call feature at the time of issue
***** - disclose when they might redeem it
***** - and at what price
**** call premium
***** - callable bonds mostly have call premium, which is above par.
***** - earlier, the call higher the premium.
**** call scenarios
***** refunding
****** The process of calling bonds   when the interest rates have fallen is called refunding
**** final settlement  bondholder will receive
***** par value
***** Semiannual coupon value
***** Call premium (if applicable)
**** beneficiary
***** issuer; as bondholder will lose higher interest
**** risk  higher
***** Reinvesting the principle received from the issuer after a call in a low-rate environment is risky/venerable for the investor.
**** interest rates paid by issuer higher
*** call protection
**** prevents calls for a period of time from the date of issue.
**** The provision is set by the issuer and based on market conditions.
*** noncallable bonds
**** Bonds issued by the federal government are not callable.
** put feature
*'***************
*** Give investors the right to demand early repayment of principal
*** Put scenarios mostly when the bond rating falls, or interest rates increase above a certain level.
*** Specified in the contract
**** one or more dates after which bondholder may exercise put
*** beneficiary:  bondholder
*** interest rate paid by the issuer is lower
** risk
*'********
*** longer the maturity higher the risk; due to the volatile nature
*** lower the coupon, higher the risk; due to the volatile nature
*** zero-coupon; due to the volatile nature
*** Call risk  investor lose high rate of interest
*** Reinvestment risk: Call risk leads to reinvestment risk as no available investments will provide similar returns as bonds that have been called.
*** inflation risk
**** CPI (Consumer Price Index)  measurement for inflation
**** Securities with a fixed rate of interest/dividends  are susceptible to inflation risk
*****, e.g., fixed coupon bonds
***** - preferred stocks
*** credit risk  when the issuer defaults
**** credit rating
***** Investment grade;  lower chance of default
***** Junk bonds or high-yield bonds have higher chances of default.
**** US federal government bonds are risk-free but pay low interest
**** Corporate bonds have comparatively higher risk but pay higher interest.
** accrued interest
*'*******************
*** Interest is added to the purchase price of the bond.
*** Number of days considered
**** corporate bonds  360 days
**** Treasury bonds  365 days
*** Accrued interest process for corporate bonds. Last Coupon Date   |  V  Trade Date   |  V  Settlement Date(T + 2)   |  V  Next Coupon Date
**** Last Coupon Date   |  V  Trade Date   |  V  Settlement Date(T + 2 - 1)  The seller owes interest beginning on the previous coupon date and up to,  but not including, the settlement date. It is paid from the buyer to the seller during the trade.
**** Settlement Date   |  V  Next Coupon Date  On the coupon date,  the buyer/owner receives the full semiannual coupon.
*** Example: bond with a par value of $1000 with a 10% coupon sold on April 11. The coupon was received on January 1 and July 1. Seller is eligible for interest for the period Jan1 to April 11 = 30 + 30 + 30 + 11 = 103 days  (note: 1 is added to settlement date but not including settlement date when we consider T+2) = 101 days  Accrued interest =  1000*(10/100)  --->  360 days  x                          ---> 105 days  x = (1000*(10/100) * 103)/360 = $28.9
*** Treasury
**** 365 days
**** T+2
*** Corporate, Municipality, MBS, and rest
**** 360 days
**** T+1
*** Cash settlement for all
**** same Day, i.e., Trade day

** Tax
*** straight line method
**** Cost basis: represents the value of an asset for tax purposes.
**** Accretion:
***** purchased at a discount
****** adjusted upward cost basis must be adjusted upward toward par each year so that at maturity, the investor's cost basis will equal par of $1,000.
***** Example: John buys a bond for $900 with 10 years until maturity.
****** discount = $1000 - $900 = $100
****** annual accretion = discount / years of maturity = 100/10 = $10
****** cost basis will be adjusted upward by $10 each year. For example, after one year, the new cost basis will be $910.
**** Amortization:
***** purchased on a premium
****** adjusted downwards cost basis will be adjusted downward each year so that at maturity, the investor's cost basis will equal a par of $1,000.
***** Example: Jane buys a bond for $1,100 with five years until maturity.
****** premium = $1100 - 1000 = $100
****** annual amortization = premium / years of maturity = 100/5 = 20$
****** cost basis will be adjusted downward by $20 each year. For example, after one year, the new cost basis will be $1,080.
*

** Credit Risk (default risk)
*** Risk associated with bonds important: note it is only applicable for bonds and not stockholders;  bondholders are creditors;  they provide credit to the issuer  while stockholders are owners  (so no credit risk applicable)

*** convertible bonds
**** A bond can be both callable and convertible<\b>.
**** convertible to a fixed number of common shares, its investors right  and can choose the date
**** calculation
**** always calculated on par value (i.e., it is fixed)
**** Conversion price(CP) is fixed and known to the investor during the purchase
**** Conversion ratio(CR) is the number of shares received on conversion.
***** CR = par value/conversion price  Example:  convertible bond with  4% interest and conversion price 40  CR= 1000 / 40 = 20  (can purchase 20 shares).
***** Conversion ratio (CR) is also fixed  as both par value and conversion price are fixed
**** parity price
***** market value of the share  is in parity with (is equal to)  the (fixed) conversion price of the convertible bond
*** Classification by:  credit risk and collateral
**** secured corporate debt backed by corporate collateral. pays lesser interest  and has a lesser credit risk, the issuer will always have the right to collateral; pledged by the issue
***** mortgage bonds backed by real state property or holdings.
****** Mortgage-backed securities  (MBS)

*** principal safety
*** low yield
*** Classification by duration
**** mid to long term
***** quoted as %age of par in 32nd of a point(1/32)  Example:  quote 11 bonds at 95:16 = 95 + (16*1/32) = 95.5% = 1000 * 95.5/100 = $955 * 11 = $10505

**** risky
**** when Interest Rates(IR) low -> more repayments(as homeowners will refinance) -> shorter maturities -> reinvestment risk(as IR are low)
**** when Interest Rates(IR) high -> no repayments -> longer maturities -> extension risk(as IR are high)
**** repayment of principal is very safe(second in safety to treasury as backed by US government)
**** tax  taxable; both federal & state
**** Cash flow:  varied every month (depends on repayments/interest rate)
**** government agencies debt securities  very safe (second in safety to treasury)  Homeowners with mortgage -> Bank -> Ginnie mae/Franniw mae/fradie mac -> issue MBS bonds

* Annuities
** Purpose
more appropriate for people who have maximized their contributions to their
other retirement plans/accounts and have additional income to set aside for the
future.
** phase
*** accumulation
**** Accumulation units represent an interest in an underlying sub-account
**** During this phase, the investor is making payments and acquiring accumulation units and is not tax liable.
*** annuitization
**** When annuitized, the accumulation units are covered into a fixed number of annuity units
**** In this phase, the investor will be tax liable
** types

*** Fixed Annuity:
A fixed annuity is an annuity that provides a guaranteed fixed rate of return on the invested funds for a certain period of time. The payment amount and the interest rate remain fixed for the entire period.
**** Hold in "general" account
**** non-security investment
**** credit and inflation risk
*** Deferred Annuity:
A deferred annuity is an annuity that begins making payments to the annuitant at a future date, such as retirement. The funds can be invested in a variety of underlying investment options, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
**** variable contracts
***** Variable Annuity:
A variable annuity is an annuity that allows the annuitant to invest in a variety of underlying investment options, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The payment amount is not fixed and varies based on the performance of the underlying investments.
****** Hold in a "separate" account
****** Annuities are considered securities and are registered with SEC and sold with a prospectus
****** credit and market risk (NOTE greatest is a market risk)
****** Market value is calculated daily.
****** being securities, they can only be sold by individuals with both insurance and securities licenses.
****** The accumulation unit will increase over time during the accumulation period, and the value will fluctuate
****** A variable annuity would be most appropriate for an individual who has maximized their contributions to their other retirement accounts and has additional income to set aside for the future.
***** variable life insurance.
It provides a death benefit to beneficiaries.
**** Indexed Annuity:
An indexed annuity is a type of fixed annuity that is linked to a stock market index, such as the S&P 500. The payment amount is based on the performance of the index, subject to a minimum guaranteed interest rate.
**** Longevity Annuity:
A longevity annuity is an annuity that provides payments to the annuitant only after a certain age, such as 80 or 85. This type of annuity is used to hedge against the risk of outliving one's savings.
**** Qualified Annuity:
A qualified annuity is an annuity that is purchased using funds from a tax-deferred retirement account, such as a 401(k) or an IRA. The payments from a qualified annuity are taxed as income.
**** Non-qualified Annuity:
A non-qualified annuity is an annuity that is purchased using funds that have already been taxed. The payments from a non-qualified annuity are taxed only on the earnings portion of the payment.
*** Immediate Annuity:
An immediate annuity is an annuity that begins making payments to the annuitant immediately after the lump sum payment is made. This type of annuity is often used for retirement income planning.

** Important notes:
*** The kind of annuity selected partly determines the payment amounts to the annuitant.
For example, a fixed annuity guarantees a specific payment amount, while a variable annuity's payment amounts are based on the performance of the underlying investment portfolio.
*** In the case of life annuity contracts, the age and sex of the annuitant can also affect the payment amounts, as the insurance company will factor in the annuitant's life expectancy.
** Distribution of interest

A Traditional IRA is an individual retirement plan. SIMPLE IRAs and SEP-IRAs are employer-sponsored.
The beneficiary of a Section 529 plan does not need to be related to the owner of the account, and there are no age requirements for the beneficiary.
Roth IRAs are only available to some with earned income. To open an account and make contributions to a Roth IRA, the participant must meet a Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) test.
IRA owners are free to buy, sell, exchange, or trade assets within their accounts without current tax consequences.

Earnings accumulate in a Traditional IRA on a tax-deferred basis, and withdrawals are fully taxable unless they represent a return of nondeductible contributions. Withdrawals made before age 59 ½ may be subject to an additional 10% penalty.

Textbook Reference
Please see textbook section 12.2.1.2
The exceptions to the 10% penalty include withdrawals on account of death or disability; for unreimbursed medical expenses above 7.5% of adjusted gross income; to pay the cost of medical insurance; taken in the form of an annuity or "substantially equal payments"; taken to buy, build or rebuild a first home; and taken by a qualified military reservist.

Textbook Reference
Please see textbook section 12.2.1.3
Answer Explanation
Surrender charges are similar to contingent deferred sales charges, or back-end loads, of B-share mutual funds.

Textbook Reference
Please see textbook section 12.3.3.4
Answer Explanation
Distributions from a 529 Plan that are used to pay for the beneficiary's qualified college education costs are federal income tax-free. These include fees for room and board.

Textbook Reference
Please see textbook section 12.4.1.4
Answer Explanation
This exception is only available to a first-time homebuyer. The new home is considered a first home if neither the IRA owner nor a spouse had an interest in a main home in the two years before the home's purchase. He would have to wait at least two years between transactions to qualify.

Textbook Reference
Please see textbook section 12.2.1.3

Answer Explanation
There are no exceptions to the five-year holding period requirement. It must be met to take a qualified distribution from a Roth IRA.

Textbook Reference
Please see textbook section 12.2.2
A variable annuity is a contract with an insurance company and is designed to provide retirement benefits. A death benefit that guarantees a return of purchase payments is not always included but can be purchased. Growth is not guaranteed, although riders can be purchased to ensure minimum benefits are available for the lifetime of the annuitant(s). Variable annuity contracts are subject to market volatility; fixed annuities are not.
