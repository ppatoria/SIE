** bonds types
*'********
*** coupon bonds
**** fixed rate bonds
****  floating or variable rate or adjustable rate bonds
***** interest rate are based on specific benchmark like treasury bill rate .
***** Example: The ray may be treasury bills + 2%
***** market value of such bonds are stable.
*** zero-coupon bonds
**** purchased in deep discount
****  Note: Zero-coupon bonds do pay interest but only at maturity.  The interest is the difference  between the discounted issue price and par or maturity value.
**** useful for long-term goal such as retirement or a college education
**** taxed on imputed or phantom interest
***** investor pays tax each year on the imputed interest
***** imputed interest = yield to maturity * present price
** yield
*'*********
*** types
**** NY (nominal yield or coupon)
***** fixed instest rate
**** CY (current yield)
***** yield in current market
***** CY = annual interest / current market price of the bond
**** YTC (yield to call)
**** YTM (yield to maturity)
*** relationship
**** when bond is trading at premium  NY > CY > YTM > YTC
**** when bond is trading at discount NY < CY < YTM < YTC
**** when bond is trading at par      NY = CY = YTM = YTC
** bond pricing
*'****************
*** price is inversely proportional to interest rates.
*** basis points (bps): unit of measurement.  100bps = 1%  75 bps =  0.75%
** call feature
*'****************
*** callable bonds
**** issuer must clearly state
***** - call feature at the time of issue
***** - disclose when they might redeem it
***** - and at what price
**** call premium
***** - callable bonds mostly have call premium; amount which is above par.
***** - earlier the call higher the premium.
**** call scenarios
***** refunding
****** The process of calling bonds   when the interest rates have fallen is called refunding
**** final settlement  boldholder will receive
***** par value
***** semiannual coupon value
***** call premium (if applicable)
**** benefitiary
***** issuer; as boldholder will loose higher interest
**** risk  higher
*****  reinvesting the principle received from the issuer after call in a low rate environment is risking/venerable for the investor.
**** interest rates payed by issuer higher
*** call protection
**** prevents call for a period of time from the date of issue.
**** the provision is set by the issuer and based on market conditions.
*** non callable bonds
**** bonds issued by federal govenment are not callable.

*** Specified in contract
**** one or more date after which bondholder may excercise put
*** benefitiory:  boldholder
*** interest rate payed by issuer islower
** risk
*'********
*** longer the maturity higher the risk; due to volatile nature
*** lower the coupon higher the risk; due to volatile nature
*** zero-coupon; due to volatile nature
*** call risk  investor loose high rate of interest
*** reinvestment risk: call risk leads to reinvestment risk as no available investments will provide similar returns as bonds that has been called.
*** inflation risk
**** CPI (Consumer Price Index)  measurement for inflation
**** securities with fixed rate of interest/dividends  are susceptible to inflation risk
***** e.g. - fixed coupon bonds
***** - prefered stocks
*** credit risk  when the issuer defaults
**** credit rating
***** investment grate  lower chance of default
***** junk bonds or high-yield bonds  higher chances of default.
**** US federal government bonds are risk-free but pay low interest
**** Corporate bonds has higher risk but pays higher interest.
** accrued interest
*'*******************
*** interest added to the purchase price of the bond.
*** Number of days considered
**** conporate bonds  360 days
**** tresury bonds  365 days
*** Accrued interest process for cororate bonds.  Last Coupon Date   |  V  Trade Date   |  V  Settlement Date(T + 2)   |  V  Next Coupon Date
**** Last Coupon Date   |  V  Trade Date   |  V  Settlement Date(T + 2 - 1)  The seller is owed interest  beginning on the previous coupon date and up to,  but not including, the settlement date.  This is paid from the buyer to the seller at the time of the trade.
**** Settlement Date   |  V  Next Coupon Date  On the coupon date,  the buyer/owner receives the full semiannual coupon.
*** example: bond with par vallue $1000 with 10% coupon is sold on April 11.  The coupon is received on Jan 1 and July 1.  Seller is eligible for interest for the period Jan1 to Aplil 11 = 30 + 30 + 30 + 11 = 103 days  (note: 1 is added to settlement date but not including selltement date when we consider T+2) = 101 days  Accrued interest =  1000*(10/100)  --->  360 days  x                          ---> 105 days  x = (1000*(10/100) * 103)/360 = $28.9
*** Treasury
**** 365 days
**** T+2
*** Corporate, Muncipality, MBS and rest
**** 360 days
**** T+1
*** Cash settlement for all
**** same day i.e Trade day

** Tax
*** straight line method
**** cost basis: represents the value of an asset for tax purposes.
**** Accretion:
***** purchased on a discount
****** adjusted upward  cost basis must be adjusted upward toward par each year  so that at maturity  the investor’s cost basis will equal par of $1,000.
***** Example: John buys a bond for $900 with 10 years until maturity.
****** discount = $1000 - $900 = $100
****** annual accretion = discount / years of maturity = 100/10 = $10
****** cost basis will be adjusted upward by $10 each year.  For example, after one year the new cost basis will be $910.
**** Amortization:
***** purchased on a premium
****** adjusted downwards  cost basis will be adjusted downward each year  so that at maturity  the investor’s cost basis will equal par of $1,000.
***** Example: Jane buys a bond for $1,100 with five years until maturity.
****** premium = $1100 - 1000 = $100
****** annual amortization = premium / years of maturity = 100/5 = 20$
****** cost basis will be adjusted downward by $20 each year.  For example, after one year, the new cost basis will be $1,080.

**** conversion ratio(CR) the number of shared received on conversion.
***** CR = par value / conversion price  Example:  convertible bond with  4% interest  and convertion price 40  CR= 1000 / 40 = 20  (can purchase 20 shares).
***** conversio ration(CR) is also fixed  as both par value and conversion price are fixed
**** parity price
***** market value of the share  is in parity with (is equal to)  the (fixed) conversion price of the convertible bond

**** risky
**** when Interest Rates(IR) low -> more repayments(as homeowners will refinance) -> shorter maturities -> reinvestment risk(as IR are low)
**** when Interest Rates(IR) high -> no repayments -> longer maturities -> extension risk(as IR are high)

*** (owner & writer) . owner is buyer and writer is seller. Buyer has to pay the premium
*** call is a contract to buy some stock at specific price called strike price.
*** call owner/buyer has to pay premium or purchase price
*** if market price - premium > strike price (In the market)
**** then caller profits as he will purchase at the stoke price which is less than the market price
*** if market price -premium = strike price

**** loss called (out of market)
**** in this case buyer will not excercise and only lose the premium
** put
*** put is a contract to sell some stock at specific price (strike price)
*** if market price + premium < strike price (in the market)
**** put seller will be in profit as he will sell at strike price which is greater than the market price
