Chapter 1 – Equity Securities

1. Treasury Stock: Treasury stock is authorized stock that was previously sold to
    the public but was repurchased by the issuer. Because it is no longer
    outstanding, the company’s share count will fall, and the shares no longer
    receive dividends or have voting rights. Treasury shares may be held by the
    company, reissued to the public, or cancelled.
2. Company Repurchases: A company that believes its stock is undervalued
    may repurchase shares in the open market (creating treasury stock).
3. Voting Rights: Holders of common stock have voting rights, which allow
    them to exercise control by electing the board of directors and voting on
    corporate policy. This contrasts with holders of preferred stock, who
    typically do not have voting rights.
4. Statutory Versus Cumulative Voting: Voting by common stockholders can
    be carried out by one of two methods.
        Statutory voting allows a shareholder to vote one time per share for
          each seat on the board of directors. For example, if an investor
          owns 100 shares of common stock and there are three board seats
          to be filled, they can cast up to 100 votes for each of the three
          seats.
        Cumulative voting allows the shareholder to pool their votes
          together and allocate them as desired. For example, the
          shareholder above can aggregate all of their votes – 300 total (
          votes x 3 seats) and allocate them however they choose (e.g. they
          could cast all 300 votes for one candidate or cast 200 for one
          candidate and the remaining for another).
5. Form 10-K: Public companies must file annual financial reports (which
includes financial statements) called 10-ks with the SEC within 90 days of
year-end.
6. Pre-Emptive Rights: Pre-emptive rights, also referred to as subscription
rights, allow a current shareholder to maintain their proportionate
ownership interest and avoid dilution when a company issues additional
shares.
7. Warrants: Warrants are typically issued by a company in conjunction with
another security to make that other security more attractive to investors.
For example, a company might use a warrant as a sweetener for investors
as part of a debt deal. Unlike pre-emptive rights, warrants do not prevent
dilution.


8. Warrants As Equity Securities: Warrants are considered equity securities
    (not debt securities) because if the warrant is exercised, the investor will
    receive shares in the underlying company. Importantly, warrants do not
    make interest payments to investors.
9. Value of Warrants: A warrant provides an investor the ability to purchase a
    company’s stock at a specified exercise price for a set time period. For
    example, the investor is given the right to purchase the stock at $100 per
    share. The investor would want to exercise this right if the price increases
    above the exercise price (e.g. an investor wants to pay $100 for stock
    worth $150 not for stock only worth $50) and therefore the market value of
    a warrant is tied to the value of the underlying stock.
10. Issuance Price of Warrants: Warrants are generally not issued with intrinsic
    value, meaning they are issued with an exercise price above the current
    market value of the stock. For example, if the current stock price is $50,
    the exercise price given to the warrants might be $80. For the warrants to
    be exercised by an investor, the price would have to increase above the
    exercise price.
11. Define Penny Stock: Penny stocks are defined as OTC equity securities
    (i.e. unlisted) worth less than $5.00 per share.
12. Blue Chip Versus Penny Stocks: Stocks of well-established, stable
    companies with a long history of steady earnings and dividends are
    known as blue chip stocks. Blue chip stocks typically trade on the major
    exchanges such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. Penny stocks are riskier, more
    volatile, and less liquid than blue chip stocks.
13. Wilshire 5000: The Wilshire 5000 is an index which measures the value of
    U.S. companies with actively traded stock.
14. Business Risk: Non-systematic risk is business risk, which is the risk that a
    specific company may not be profitable.
15. Risk of ADRs: American depositary receipts (ADRs) help to facilitate the
    trading of a foreign corporation’s stock in the US. Investors in ADRs face
    political risk, which is the risk that political instability and uncertainty in that
    foreign country might negatively impact their investment. Importantly,
    because ADRs are common stock and not debt securities, they do not
    have call risk or interest rate risk.
16. Withholding Taxes: When a foreign corporation pays a dividend, a bank
    will take the foreign dividend payment (e.g. Euro or Japanese Yen) and
    convert it into US dollars for the ADR holder. It is possible that the ADR
    holder might receive a lower dividend than was actually declared
    because the foreign government might withhold a percentage of the
    dividend for taxes.


17. Cumulative Preferred Stock: Cumulative preferred stock allows investors to
    receive dividends in arrears. This means that if a dividend is skipped for
    cumulative preferred shareholders, they must receive both current and
    skipped dividend payments before any dividend payment can be made
    to common shareholders. This is a benefit for the investor as it entitles them
    to receive missed dividend payments.
18. Transfer Agent Versus Custodian: A transfer agent of an issuer is
    responsible for issuing and cancelling certificates and processing investor
    mailings (e.g. proxies). A custodian, on the other hand, is responsible for
    holding investor assets or securities for protections. A custodian may also
    maintain certain investor records.
19. Cash Dividend Taxation: Cash dividends on stock received by an investor
    are taxable as ordinary income and do not increase the investor’s cost
    basis.
20. Ex-Dividend Date: The ex-date is the first day purchasers of the stock will
    not receive a dividend. This is because the trade will not settle on or
    before the record date. For a regular way trade, which settles T + 2 (two
    business days after the trade date), the ex-date is the business day before
    the record date.
21. Order of Dividend Process: Make sure to know the order of dates in the
    dividend payment process. 1) Declaration Date, 2) Ex-Dividend Date, 3)
    Record Date, 4) Payment Date.
22. Stock Splits: A stock split is an artificial adjustment in the issuer’s
    outstanding share count and stock price. Importantly, because the
    number of shares and price change in proportion with one another, the
    overall value of the company as well as the investor’s ownership position
    in the company remain unchanged. For example, if an investor owned
    $1,000 of stock before a stock split, they will still own $1,000 of stock after.
23. Forward Stock Split: In a forward stock split, the number of outstanding
    shares increases, and the share price is reduced proportionally. For
    example, after a 2-for-1 split an investor owning 100 shares of stock at $
    per share will now own 200 shares at $15 per share. Both before and after
    the split, the value of the investor’s position remains $3,000.
24. Reverse Stock Split: In a reverse stock split, the number of outstanding
    shares is reduced, and the share price is increased proportionally.
    Generally, a reverse split is used by a company to inflate their stock price
    and avoid falling below the minimum price required for exchange listing.
    For example, after a 1-for-10 split an investor owning 100 shares of stock at
    $1 per share will now own 10 shares at $10 per share. Both before and
    after the split, the value of the investor’s position remains $100.


25. Stock Dividend Taxation: Stock dividends are not taxed when received by
    a shareholder. However, the basis of the investor’s position is adjusted
    downward to reflect the new number of shares.
        Example: Assume an investor holds 100 shares of stock valued at $
          per share and receives a 10% stock dividend. The $5,000 value ($
          x 100 shares) of the total position does not change, so the investor
          now has 110 shares with an adjusted basis of $45.45 (calculated as
          $5,000 total value/110 shares).
26. Short Sale: Selling short is when an investor, believing the price of the
    security will decline, sells borrowed shares in the market, hoping to
    repurchase and replace the shares at a lower price than what they were
    initially sold for. Theoretically, because the price of the shares can rise
    indefinitely (rather than fall as the investor wants), short sellers have
    unlimited risk potential.

Chapter 2 – Debt Securities

1. Discount Versus Premium Bond: When the market value of a bond is
    greater than the par value, the bond is trading at a premium. If the
    market value of the bond is below par value, the bond is trading at a
    discount.
2. Basis Points: Basis points (bps) are a unit of measurement used to discuss
    changes in interest rates. Each basis point equals one-hundredth of a
    percentage point and therefore 100 bps is the equivalent of 1%.
3. Nominal Yield: Also referred to as the coupon, the nominal yield is the
    annual interest rate paid to the investor. Unlike other bond yields, the
    nominal yield is fixed and does not change over the life of the bond. For
    example, a bond that pays a 5% coupon, pays the same 5% of $1,
    (par value) or $50 of interest per year throughout the life of the bond.
4. Current Yield: The current yield of a bond is calculated as the annual
    interest divided by the market price. If the semiannual coupon is
    provided, make sure to multiply by two to annualize.
        Example: A bond is trading at $960 and pays a $15 semiannual
          coupon. Current yield is calculated as the annual interest of $
          ($15 x 2) divided by the market price of $960. Therefore, current
          yield is 3.1%.
5. Bond Yields: Be sure to know the relationship between nominal yield (NY),
    current yield (CY), yield-to-maturity (YTM), and yield-to-call (YTC) for both
    discount and premium bonds.


```
 For a discount bond, the order from lowest to highest is NY, CY, YTM,
YTC.
 For a premium bond, the order from lowest to highest is YTC, YTM,
CY, NY.
```
6. Interest Rate Risk: The risk that if interest rates increase, the price of
    outstanding bonds will fall. Long-term, low-coupon bonds (including zero-
    coupon bonds) have the greatest interest rate risk, meaning they are most
    sensitive to changing rates. Although a Treasury bond has no credit risk, as
    they are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the US government,
    they still are very susceptible to interest rate risk given their long-term (e.g.
    30 year) maturity.
7. Reinvestment Rate Risk: The risk that as interest rates fall, that the semi-
    annual coupon payments that an investor receives will be reinvested
    back into the market at a lower rate of return. Note that zero coupon
    bonds do not have reinvestment rate risk as there are no cash flows to
    reinvest.
8. Duration: Duration is a measure of a bond’s sensitivity to changing interest
    rates. Bonds with a longer duration are more sensitive to changing rates.
9. Bond Pricing: The price of a bond is affected most by interest rates.
    Factors like credit rating, market demand, and earnings potential of the
    company are not as impactful.
10. Serial Bonds: In a serial bond issue, the outstanding bonds mature at
    different intervals with a portion of the issue maturing each year.
11. Call Feature: If a bond is callable, the issuer has the right to buy it back
    from the investor prior to maturity. Typically, the issuer will redeem a bond
    if interest rates decline, allowing the company to issue new bonds at a
    lower interest rate. A call feature benefits the issuer, not the investor.
12. Call Protection: Issuers can call callable bonds at any time unless the
    bond has a call protection period. If there is call protection, the issuer
    must wait until the period expires. Callable bonds with call protection are
    safer for investors.
        Example: A 20-year bond with a 10-year call protection period
          could be called any time after year 10 through maturity.
13. Call Price: When an issuer calls bonds, it must pay the investor par value +
    any call premium (if applicable) + interest accrued to that date. Investors
    receive no interest after the bond is called.
14. Default: If an interest payment is missed on an outstanding debt
    obligation, the bond will default.


15. Credit Ratings: Bond rating services publish credit ratings to inform
    investors of a bond’s credit quality. A bonds credit rating may change
    periodically while it is outstanding. Credit ratings are typically a big factor
    in the liquidity of bonds (even more so than the coupon or maturity).
16. Adjusting Premium Bonds by Amortization: Bonds purchased at a premium
    (> $1,000 par) must be amortized over the life of the bond. Amortization
    means that the cost basis will be adjusted downwards each year so that
    at maturity an investor’s cost basis is $1,000 par. What will amortization
    effect? Amortization effects a bond’s cost basis (downwards) and should
    the investor sell the bond prior to maturity, the profit or loss on the
    transaction. Amortization does not affect sale proceeds (what a
    purchaser is willing to pay).
        Example: When an investor purchases a bond at a premium, the
          cost basis will be adjusted downward towards par on a straight-line
          basis. This is referred to as amortization. For example, a 10-year
          bond bought at 110 would be adjusted by one point per year,
          calculated as: 10-point premium / 10 years to maturity = 1 point per
          year.
17. Accretion of Discount Bonds: Discount bonds will be accreted, which is
    similar to amortization, but the cost basis is adjusted upwards (towards
    par) each year.
18. Accrued Interest: Accrued interest is the interest paid by the buyer of the
    bond to the seller of the bond when the bond is trading between coupon
    dates. A bond the trades with accrued interest is said to trade “and” or
    “with” interest. The accrued interest is taxable for the recipient as ordinary
    income, though it does not impact the cost basis of the bond. A bond
    that trades without accrued interest (e.g. a bond in default, or a zero
    coupon instrument) is said to trade flat.
19. Dated Date: The dated date is the date when interest begins to accrue on
    fixed income securities. The dated date is only relevant for new issuances
    and once regular semi-annual coupon payments begin, it is no longer
    relevant.

Chapter 3 – Types of Bonds

1. Unsecured Corporate Debt: Unsecured corporate debt is not backed by
    collateral or a specific asset of the corporation. Instead, it is backed by
    the good faith and credit quality of the company. It is also referred to as a
    debenture bond.
2. Convertible Bonds: Convertible bonds are a type of corporate bond
    where the investor has the right to convert the bond into the company’s
    underlying common stock. Because of this conversion benefit for the


```
investor, convertible bonds pay a lower rate of interest compared to
similar non-convertible bonds.
```
3. Convertible Bond Pricing: The value of a convertible bond is based on the
    value of the underlying common stock, since the investor can exchange
    the bond for the shares. The parity price is the value at which the investor
    is mathematically indifferent between owning the bond or converting into
    the underlying shares.
4. Conversion Ratio: The number of shares received upon conversion of a
    convertible bond is known as the conversion ratio. An investor can
    calculate conversion ratio by taking par value and dividing it by the
    conversion price. Both the conversion ratio and conversion price are fixed
    at issuance of the convertible bond.
5. Non-Marketable US Government Securities: The US government issues
    both marketable and non-marketable debt securities. Marketable
    securities can be freely traded by investors and include US Treasury
    securities, such as Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds. Non-
    marketable securities, for example US savings bonds, cannot be resold by
    investors and therefore have no secondary market.
6. Series I Bond: A Series I bond is a non-marketable US Treasury savings
    bond. It pays a combination of fixed and variable interest (linked to the
    rate of inflation).
7. Risk of Treasury Securities: Treasury securities do not have credit risk but
    are subject to interest rate risk, purchasing power risk and political risk. An
    investor purchasing treasury securities would be more concerned with
    interest rate risk than political or credit risk.
8. Taxation of Treasury Securities: The interest income from Treasury bonds is
    taxed at the federal level, but not at the state or local levels.
9. Treasury Receipts: Treasury receipts are zero-coupon bonds that are
    structured by broker-dealers but backed by cash flows from Treasury
    securities. Because they are zeros, they pay no interest until maturity.
10. STRIPS: STRIPS are zero coupon bonds that are issued and backed by the
    US Government. They are issued at a discount and mature to face value.
11. General Obligation Bonds: GO bonds are municipal securities used to
    finance non-revenue facilities, such as public parks, public schools, and
    public libraries. The interest and principal is backed by the full taxing
    power of the issuing municipality.
12. Industrial Development Revenue Bonds: Industrial development revenue
    bonds are a type of taxable municipal security that is issued by a
    municipality on behalf of a corporation. Specifically, the municipality will


```
issue to debt to build a facility on behalf of a corporation and then lease
that facility to the corporation. Because the bonds are backed by lease
payments made by the corporation, the debt is the responsibility and
credit quality of the corporation.
```
13. Official Statement: The official statement is the primary disclosure
    document used in a municipal security offering. It includes all relevant
    information for investors, such as the risks of the bonds.
14. Ginnie Mae: Along with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae is an
    issuer of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). However, Ginnie is the only
    one of the three that is backed by the full faith and credit of the US
    government. Because Fannie and Freddie are government sponsored
    enterprises, they only have an implied, but not an explicit backing of the
    US government.
15. Agency Securities: Securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and
    Freddie Mac – sometimes collectively referred to as “Agency Securities” –
    are taxable at the federal, state, and local levels.
16. Securitization: Securitization is the process of pooling individual mortgages
    together to create mortgage-backed securities.
17. Risks of Mortgage-Backed Securities: MBSs issued by Ginnie, Fannie and
    Freddie face prepayment risk and extension risk.
18. Money Market Instruments: Money market securities are short-term debt
    instruments with maturities of one year or less. Because of their short-term
    nature, they tend to be relatively liquid and low risk compared to longer-
    term bonds. Examples include Treasury bills, commercial paper,
    negotiable CDs, and banker’s acceptances. Additionally, once a Treasury
    bond has only one year or less remaining until maturity, it can trade in the
    money market.
19. Commercial Paper: Commercial paper is an unsecured promissory note,
    issued by corporations at a discount. It typically has a maximum maturity
    of 270 days.
20. Banker’s Acceptances: A banker’s acceptance is a short-term,
    negotiable money market instrument that is used to finance and facilitate
    international trade. It has a maturity of 180 days or less and is issued by a
    borrower and guaranteed by a commercial bank.
21. Eurodollar Deposit: Eurodollars are U.S. Dollars held in a depository (bank)
    abroad. E.g. A swiss bank account denominated in U.S. dollars would
    hold Eurodollar deposits. These are used by foreign corporations (or
    individuals) who have US currency abroad.


22. Eurodollar Bonds: Eurodollar bonds are bonds issued outside the United
    States (e.g. Argentina) but denominated in U.S. dollars. Par is $1,000 USD;
    coupon payments are made in USD. These are issued and trade outside
    the U.S. and are not registered with the SEC. Issuers use Eurodollar bonds
    to make their securities more marketable (e.g. the issuer’s home currency
    is unstable).
23. Certificates of Deposit (CD): Most CDs offered to individuals are non-
    negotiable, which means they cannot be traded in the secondary
    market, but instead only redeemed with the issuing bank. Negotiable CDs
    can be traded in the secondary market and have a minimum face value
    of $100,000.
24. Tax-Equivalent Yield: To determine the interest an investor must earn on a
    taxable corporate bond to equal the tax-free yield of a municipal bond,
    an investor can calculate the tax-equivalent yield, which is the tax-free
    yield of the municipal bond divided by (100% - Tax Rate).

```
 Example: For an investor in the 35% tax bracket who owns a 5% tax-
free municipal bond, the tax-equivalent yield is 7.69%, calculated as
5%/(100% - 35%). This means that a taxable bond yielding 7.69%
produces equal after-tax income to a tax-free municipal bond
yielding 5% for this investor in the 35% tax bracket.
```
Chapter 4 – Investment Company Securities

1. Summary Prospectus: The SEC allows a mutual fund to deliver a summary
    prospectus to shareholders, which is a compilation of highlights from the
    longer prospectus. A summary prospectus includes the fund’s investment
    objectives, fee structure, and other pertinent information. It must be
    provided to investors prior to or at the time of sale.
2. Mutual Fund Shareholder Reports: Mutual funds are required to send
    financial reports to shareholders which include financial statements (e.g. a
    balance sheet and income statement) and detail the holdings of the
    fund’s portfolio. These reports must be sent semiannually.
3. Mutual Fund Custodian: A bank or trust company acts as custodian for
    mutual fund sand is responsible for the holding and safekeeping of the
    fund’s securities and cash.
4. Net Investment Income: Net investment income is the total profits that an
    individual earns from their investments. For mutual fund investments, this
    would include any dividends plus interest income plus net capital gains
    (capital gains minus capital losses).


5. Forward Pricing: When an investor purchases shares of a mutual fund, the
    price they pay is based on the next NAV (net asset value) calculation
    after the order is received. The NAV is calculated daily based on the
    closing price of the market. This is referred to as forward pricing. For
    example, if on Monday a customer places an order to buy shares at
    5:00pm, which is after the market close, the price they would pay for the
    shares is based on Tuesday’s closing price. The share price is not
    calculated based on the prior day’s closing price or the next day’s
    opening price.
6. Expense Ratio: Every mutual fund has an expense ratio, which is the
    percentage of the fund’s total assets that will be used to cover the
    expenses of the fund. It is calculated as (management fees plus operating
    expenses) divided by the average annual net assets of the fund. The
    fund’s expense ratio would increase if the operating expenses of the fund
    were rising faster than the value of the fund’s investments.
7. 12b-1 Fee: 12b-1 fees are annual fees paid by mutual funds shareholders
    to cover the marketing and administrative expenses of the fund. 12b-
    fees do not cover management expenses or trading fees.
8. Fund Share Classes: Mutual funds can have different share classes. Class A
    shares have an upfront sales charge. Class B shares have a back-end
    load (aka contingent deferred sales charges or CDSCs), which investors
    pay when they redeem their shares. Class C shares have level loads. All
    share classes have 12b-1 fees, but Class B and C 12b-1 fees are usually
    higher than Class A shares. Class A shares are the only share class that can
    benefit from breakpoints.
9. Sales Charge: When an investor buys mutual fund shares, a sales charge
    (also called a sales load) generally applies. Sales charge can be
    expressed as a percentage of the POP, never the NAV.
10. Calculating POP: When provided a mutual fund’s NAV and sales charge
    percentage, the POP can be calculated as the NAV/ (100% - Sales
    Charge %).
        Example: If a mutual fund has an NAV of $10 and has a 4% sales
          charge, the POP = $10 NAV / (100% - 4% sales charge), or $10.42.
11. No-Load Fund: No-load funds are mutual funds that do not charge a sales
    charge. They are purchased by investors at the NAV.
12. Mutual Fund Suitability: When deciding on a mutual fund investment, the
    investor’s investment objectives are the primary consideration. Fees are of
    secondary importance. Note that the size of the fund is typically the least
    important factor.


13. Letter of Intent (LOI): A letter of intent allows a mutual fund shareholder to
    invest in installments and receive breakpoints, which are discounts off of
    the sales charge. A letter of intent can be used for up to 13 months and
    can be backdated 90 days.
14. Rights of Accumulation: Rights of accumulation offer investors an
    opportunity to receive a reduced sales charge based on the amount of
    money invested into one mutual fund. This includes breakpoints for
    combination purchases, which allows an investor to aggregate their
    investments within the same mutual fund family of funds to reduce the
    sales charge. For example, an investor can combine investments made in
    three separate Fidelity mutual funds to meet a breakpoint and receive a
    reduced sales charge.
15. Breakpoint Sale: A breakpoint sale is a violation where a registered rep
    suggests that an investor purchases a mutual fund just below the point at
    which they would receive a discounted sales charge. For example, if
    there is a breakpoint at $250,000, suggesting the customer only invest
    $249,000 is a violation.
16. Municipal Bond Funds: A municipal bond fund, also referred to as a tax-
    exempt bond fund, is a mutual fund consisting of tax-free municipal
    bonds. These funds are most appropriate for high-net-worth investors in
    high tax brackets who will most benefit from the tax-free nature of the
    interest income. When the fund pays out its net investment income to
    investors, the dividends are tax-free because they represent the tax-free
    interest income, though any capital gains distributions are taxable.
17. Money Market Fund: Money market funds are mutual funds consisting of
    money market securities, which are debt securities with maturities of one
    year or less. Because of the nature of the securities they invest in, money
    market funds are extremely safe and highly liquid. These funds generally
    attempt to maintain a stable NAV of $1.00 per share, though the price
    can fluctuate above or below that amount. Investments in a money
    market fund are least exposed to currency risk as the investments are held
    in US dollars. They would be subject to inflationary risk.
18. Mutual Fund Investment Strategies: Mutual funds can invest in equities,
    corporate bonds and other registered securities. An investor who is
    seeking a combination of interest income and growth potential can invest
    in a diversified mutual fund that offers exposure to both debt and equity.
19. Prohibited Mutual Fund Strategies: Mutual funds cannot sell stock short or
    borrow money.
20. Cost Basis: Cost basis is the original value of an asset for tax purposes. If
    the asset is later sold for a profit, the difference between the cost basis


```
and sales proceeds reflects the investor’s taxable capital gain.
Importantly, any dividends reinvested by an investor would increase their
cost basis as the investor will have already paid tax on that income. For
example, if an investor’s original cost basis in a mutual fund is $1,000 and
the investor receives $200 in dividends which they reinvest into the fund,
their cost basis would be adjusted upwards to $1,200.
```
21. Mutual Fund Dividends: Mutual fund cash dividends are taxable for
    investors regardless of whether they are taken in cash or reinvested back
    into the fund.
22. Impact of Dividends on NAV: The NAV of a mutual fund share will
    decrease by the amount of the dividend on the ex-date. This is because
    the fund is paying out cash so the fund’s assets will fall.
23. Index Fund Reconstitution: Index funds are mutual funds that seek to track
    the performance of a specific index – i.e. the S&P 500. Because they
    simply track an index and are not actively managed they have lower fees
    and expenses than other types of mutual funds. Generally, the only time
    the portfolio changes is when a company is added or subtracted from the
    benchmark index. For example, when Facebook was added to the S&P
    500, all of the index funds that tracked the S&P 500 purchased Facebook
    stock. The process of updating the portfolio to continue to mirror the
    underlying index is referred to as reconstitution.
24. Closed-End Fund Pricing: Similar to mutual funds, closed-end funds have a
    net asset value, which is the total assets of the fund minus the total
    liabilities. However, because closed-end funds are exchange-traded, they
    can trade at a price either above or below their NAV based on the supply
    and demand of the shares.
25. Unit Investment Trust (UIT): A UIT is an investment company security that
    combines redeemable shares with a fixed portfolio. Specifically, the
    portfolio is assembled by a sponsor, who does not actively trade the
    portfolio.
26. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): ETFs are investment company securities
    that are designed to track a specific index or benchmark. Like closed-end
    funds, ETFs are exchange-traded and thus investors pay commissions
    when purchasing the shares.
27. ETFs Versus Mutual Funds: Mutual fund shares are redeemable, which
    means they can only be bought from and sold back to the mutual fund.
    There is no secondary market for mutual funds. In contrast, ETFs are
    exchange-traded and can be bought and sold between investors
    throughout the day. Because ETFs have a secondary market, they are
    considered more liquid than mutual funds.


28. ETF Versus Mutual Fund Expenses: Because mutual funds are actively
    managed, they typically have higher fees for investors than ETFs.

Chapter 5 – Other Managed Products

1. REITs: A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns or
    operates income-producing real estate or real estate-related assets. It is
    not an investment company or direct participation program (DPP). REITs
    are not subject to corporate tax (they pass through gains, though not
    losses)) if they meet all three of the following criteria:
       i. At least 75% of the assets must be invested in real estate
ii. At least 75% of the REIT’s income must be derived from real estate,
and
iii. 90% of the gains must be passed through to investors
2. REIT Investment Objective: The primary investment objective for a REIT
    investor is current income in the form of dividends. This is because REITs are
    required to pay out at least 90% of income to investors.
3. REIT Dividends: Dividends paid by a REIT are always taxed as ordinary
    income, regardless of the holding period. This contrasts with dividends paid
    by traditional corporations which are taxed at a lower rate as long as the
    investor holds the stock for greater than 60 days.
4. Equity REITs: Equity REITs own and operate income-producing real estate.
    They are professionally managed to generate income from rent received
    as well as sales from the properties they hold.
5. Depletion: Depletion is a tax deduction that compensates a limited
    partnership as they use up a natural resource such as oil or gas. Because
    real estate is not a natural resource it cannot be depleted.
6. Passive Gains and Losses: Direct participation programs (DPPs) pass
    through gains and losses to investors, which means there is no corporate
    taxation, instead only the investors in the program pay tax. If there is a
    passive loss, it can only be used to offset passive gains.
7. General Versus Limited Partners: In a limited partnership, the general
    partner is the active partner in the business, managing the day-to-day,
    whereas the limited partner contributes capital and from that point has a
    passive involvement in the business. The general partner has unlimited
    personal liability, whereas the limited partners have limited liability.
8. Partnership Agreement: A partnership is established by an agreement
    between two or more individuals or entities. The partnership agreement
    binds the parties and details which partners can transact for the account.


9. Interest in a Limited Partnership: An interest in a limited partnership is an
    equity security as it indicates the partner owns a piece of the partnership.
10. S-Corp Versus C-Corp: An S corporation is a type of DPP. Shareholders
    receive a pass-through of income and losses, and the S-Corp entity is not
    taxed. A C corporation is a taxable entity and shareholders receive
    dividends that were taxed at the entity level and will be taxed again at the
    shareholder level. Double taxation applies to dividends from C-Corps.
11. Raw Land Limited Partnership: Raw land LPs invest in a piece of land
    hoping that it increases in value over time and that it can eventually be
    sold for a profit. Because the land is not developed, there is no income or
    depreciation from the ownership interest.
12. Dissolution of a Limited Partnership: When a limited partnership is dissolved,
    the priority of claims against the partnership is:
       i. Secured lenders
ii. General creditors
iii. Limited partners
iv. General partners
13. Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are typically only suitable investments for
    institutional and sophisticated investors. This is because they often pursue
    aggressive trading strategies, such as the use of derivatives as well as
    purchasing stocks of distressed companies or those of public companies
    looking to go private.
14. Hedge Fund Managers: Hedge fund managers receive management and
    performance fees which are typically higher than fees charged for other
    fund investments.
15. Fund of Hedge Funds: An investment in a “fund of hedge funds” offers the
    liquidity of a mutual fund, but with risk more associated with a hedge fund.
16. Prime Brokerage Accounts: Prime brokerage is a suite of bundled services
    offered to hedge funds and other large institutional investors by banks and
    wealth management firms.
17. Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs): ETNs are of unsecured corporate debt
    issued by a broker-dealer that combines principal protection with equity
    market upside exposure. Because they are unsecured, although their
    return is based on an underlying equity, they do not actually own that
    security. This contrasts with ETFs, which own the securities in their portfolio.
    The credit quality of an ETN is based on that of the issuing broker-dealer.


Chapter 6 – Options

1. Options Clearing Corporation (OCC): The OCC issues and guarantees all
    listed options contracts. Therefore, if an investor wants to exercise an
    options position, their broker-dealer would notify the OCC who would
    then assign their contract to an appropriate counterparty.
2. Listed Options: A listed option is issued by the OCC and not by the
    underlying corporation (e.g. Apple or Facebook). Therefore, listed options
    have no impact on the capital structure of a corporation as the company
    itself is not raising money. A stock or bond issuance by a corporation
    would impact its capital structure.
3. American-Style Options: American-style options can be exercised at the
    strike price any time up to and including the expiration date. This contrasts
    with European-style options which can only be exercised on the expiration
    date.
4. LEAPS: A LEAP is a long-term option contract with a maturity of up to three
    years. Operating like a conventional short-term option contract, a LEAP
    provides an investor with longer exposure to the price movement of the
    underlying security.
5. In-The-Money vs. Out-of-The-Money: Whether an option is exercised or
    not depends on the relationship of the current market value of the
    underlying shares and the strike price of the option. Premium is not a
    factor of how ITM an option is.
        A. Call options are ITM if the current market value is greater than the
          strike price
        B. Put options are ITM if the current market value is lower than the
          strike price
6. At-the-Money: Options are at-the-money when the market value is equal
    to the strike price. When the option is at-the-money, the owner of the
    option would let is expire and lose their premium.
7. Spot Price: Spot price is another term that can be used to describe the
    current market price of a stock. For example, if a call option is purchased
    with a strike price of $50, while the current spot price is $40, the call option
    is out-of-the-money.
8. Liquidate an Option: If an investor owns a call option which is in-the-
    money (e.g. they own a 50 call with the stock trading at $60), the investor
    will not necessarily exercise the option. Instead, they may opt to liquidate
    their position (sell the option contract to another investor).


9. Maximum Gain on Long Call: When an investor buys a call option, they
    have the right to buy the underlying stock at the strike price. Because
    there is no limit on how high the stock price can rise, the maximum gain is
    unlimited.
10. Obligation of Call Writer: If a call writer receives an assignment notice,
    they will have an obligation to sell the stock at the strike price. In return for
    this obligation, they receive the premium. Options are always written to
    generate income in the form of the premium.
11. Risk of Uncovered Call: When an investor sells an uncovered call, they are
    writing a call option without owning the underlying stock. This position has
    unlimited risk because no matter how high the price of the stock
    increases, the writer is obligated to purchase the shares in the market and
    then sell the stock at the strike price. Because of this risk profile, uncovered
    calls are typically inappropriate for retail investors.
12. Covered Call Breakeven: A covered call is a strategy where an investor
    sells a call option on a stock, while also owning that stock. To calculate
    the breakeven of a covered call, which is the market value where there is
    no profit or loss on the position, subtract the premium received from the
    purchase price of the stock.
        Example: Investor owns 100 shares of XYZ stock @50 and sells 1 XYZ
          Nov Call @5. The breakeven is $45 ($50 - $5). Put differently, the $
          premium received for writing the option provides investor with $5 of
          downside protection on their stock.
13. Long Put Breakeven: The breakeven of a put option is calculated as the
    strike price minus the premium. Take note, that purchasing multiple
    contracts would not impact the breakeven point.
        Example: Investor buys 3 ABC Nov 60 Puts @5. The breakeven is $
          ($60 - $5). The fact that the customer purchased three contracts
          does not change breakeven.
14. Protecting a Short Put: If an investor sells (shorts) a put option, they have an
    obligation to purchase the stock at the strike price regardless of how far
    the price has fallen if they option is exercised against them. If the investor
    wants to hedge against some of the downside risk, they can buy a put
    option with a lower strike price in order to lock in a sale price for the
    shares.
15. Volatility Market Index (VIX): The VIX, often referred to as the “fear index”,
    measures the volatility of S&P 500 index options. VIX options have
    European-style exercises, which means they can only be exercised on the
    day of expiration.


16. Index Options: Stock index options allow investors to speculate on the
    performance of an index (e.g. S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100) or hedge their
    existing stock portfolio. If an investor has a diversified portfolio of stocks
    and they are concerned about market risk, they can purchase puts on
    that an index to protect their portfolio. Index options are settled in cash;
    there is no stock transaction.
17. Foreign Currency Options: Foreign currency options allow investors to
    speculate on how foreign currencies will perform compared to the US
    dollar. Because of that an investor cannot buy or sell US dollar options.
18. Option Contract Adjustment: Options contracts are adjusted for stock
    dividends as well as for stock splits. For a stock dividend, the number of
    shares the contract represents will increase, while the strike price will
    decrease proportionately. The total value of the contract does not
    change. The same is true for a forward split.
        Example: An ABC 60 call is subject to a 6% stock dividend. The total
          value of the contract is $60 strike price x 100 shares per contract =
          $6,000. After the stock dividend, the investor will now have 106
          shares (6% more). To find the new strike price: $6,000 total value
          divided by 106 shares equals $56.60.
19. Option Series: Options series are all call or put contracts in the same class
    (call or put) with identical strike prices and expiration dates. For example,
    a March 80 call and a March 80 put are of the same series

Chapter 7 – Suitability and Investment Risks

1. Institutional Threshold: Under FINRA suitability rules, an individual with
    assets of at least $50 million is considered an institutional investor.
2. Preferred Stock Investment Objective: Preferred stock pays a fix quarterly
    dividend and is therefore appropriate for an investor seeking current
    income. However, because of the fixed dividend, preferred stock does
    not have as much potential for appreciation and capital gains. For an
    investor seeking growth, common stock would be more suitable.
3. Liquidity Risk: A security that cannot easily be sold is said to have liquidity
    risk. Examples of illiquid investments include direct participation programs
    and thinly traded stocks, such as penny stocks.
4. Safety and Preservation of Capital: An investment objective in which an
    investor seeks no decline in the value of their investments. Suitable
    investments for this strategy would include highly rated instruments such as
    Treasury and money market securities. Investments where there is a risk of
    loss of principal, such as common stock, penny stocks, direct participation
    programs, and high-yield bonds, are inappropriate.


5. Fund Investing: If the manager of a fund believes there might be a short-
    term drop in the market, they could keep excess cash in cash and cash
    equivalents and then buy the dip.
6. Total Return on Equity: The total return on a stock investment is calculated
    as (dividends plus capital gains) divided by the initial purchase price of
    the shares.
        Example: Jane purchased ABC stock for $100 and sold it one year
          later for $110. She also received $5 in dividends. Total return = ($
          dividend + $10 capital gain)/$100 purchase price = 15%
7. Current Yield of Common Stock: Another way to evaluate the return on
    common stock is by calculating its current yield, which is the annual
    dividend divided by the current market price. Make sure that if a quarterly
    dividend is provided that you annualize it by multiplying by four.
        Example: XYZ stock is trading at $15 and pays a quarterly dividend
          of $0.30. Current yield = ($0.30 x 4)/$15 = 8%
8. Dividends and Current Yield: If a company’s dividend is reduced, but the
    stock price stays the same, current yield will fall.

Chapter 8 – Issuing Securities

1. Preliminary Prospectus: A preliminary prospectus can be used to market
    to investors during the cooling-off period. It includes a description of the
    offering, the planned use of the proceeds, risk factors, description of
    management, as well as financial statements. The preliminary prospectus
    will generally not include the timely details of the transaction, such as the
    offer price or number of shares being registered. Instead, buyers must still
    receive a final prospectus no later than the settlement date of the
    transaction, which includes this information.
2. SEC Effectiveness: When the SEC declares a new issue effective, it clears
    the securities for public sale. At this time a registered rep could say the
    issue has been deemed effective, but could not say that it has been
    approved by the SEC.
3. Prospectus Delivery: A prospectus or notice of its availability must be
    delivered to investors for any sales for the first 25 days following an IPO.
4. Exempt Securities: Treasury securities, municipal bonds, and commercial
    paper (with a maximum maturity of 270 days) are exempt from SEC
    registration. However, open-end funds (mutual funds) are required to
    register with the SEC.


5. Rule 147: Rule 147 allows an in-state business to raise capital in their home
    state and avoid SEC registration. Under 147, 100% of the securities must be
    sold to state residents who cannot resell outside the state for six months.
6. Regulation D: Regulation D is an exemption from SEC registration for
    private placements. In a Reg D transaction, there are two types of
    investors – accredited and non-accredited. Accredited investors include
    1) officers and directors of the issuer, 2) institutions with at least $5 million in
    assets, and 3) individuals with a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding
    the value of their primary residence or individuals who earned at least
    $200,000 in each of the past two years ($300,000 for married couples).
    Anyone who is not defined as accredited is considered a non-accredited
    investor. Although different types of private placement transactions exist,
    generally there can be an unlimited number of accredited investors and
    a maximum of 35 non-accredited participating in the deal.
7. Retired Individuals Accredited Status: An individual who consistently made
    at least $200,000 during his or her career but has since retired would not
    be accredited because once he or she retires there is not a reasonable
    expectation for a similar income to continue.
8. Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE): A PIPE is when a public company
    raises capital through a private placement. A company might do this to
    raise capital quickly and avoid the SEC registration process.
9. Offering Memorandum: An offering memorandum is provided to investors
    for disclosure like a prospectus, except it is used for offerings that are
    exempt from SEC registration like private placements. Audited financial
    statements are not required in an offering memorandum.
10. Form 144: Under Rule 144, an insider is required to file Form 144 with the
    SEC prior to selling control stock into the open market. Note that is the
    aggregate dollar amount of the sales will not exceed $50,000 over the
    next three-months, then Form 144 is not required to be filed.
11. Regulation S: Reg S is an exempt transaction which allows an issuer to raise
    money outside the U.S. and avoid SEC registration.
12. Regulation A: Reg A is an exempt transaction which allows an issuer to
    raise a maximum of $75 million publicly in a 12-month period without
    having to go through the full SEC registration process.
13. Qualified Institutional Buyer (QIB): Rule 144A allows QIBs to freely trade
    unregistered securities (e.g. private placements) among themselves. A
    QIB is defined as an institution that manages at least $100 million of
    discretionary assets.


14. Tender Offer Minimum Threshold: A tender offer is an offer by a company
    or an outside investor to purchase at least 5% of the company’s shares
    directly from the company’s shareholders. The purchaser making the offer
    might qualify a tender with a minimum number of acceptable shares. This
    means that unless shareholders agree to sell a certain number of shares,
    the investor making the offer will not go through with any purchases.
        Example: InvestorCo is looking to purchase up to 10 million shares of
          Company ABC at a price of $25 per share. InvestorCo sets a
          minimum threshold of 8 million shares. If the shareholders of
          Company ABC only agree to tender 6 million shares collectively,
          InvestorCo will not go through with any purchases since the
          minimum threshold was not met.
15. All Holders Best Price: All shareholders receive the exact same price in a
    tender offer. This is sometimes referred to as “all holders best price”.
16. Oversubscribed Tender Offers: If a tender offer is oversubscribed, the
    shares are accepted proportionally from those shareholders who
    tendered.
        Example: If an investor seeks to purchase 10 million shares in a
          tender offer, but shareholders collectively tender 100 million shares,
          only 10% of each shareholders’ shares will be accepted. Therefore,
          if a shareholder tendered 1,000 shares, only 100 of their shares (10%)
          will actually be accepted.
17. Follow-On Offering: A follow-on is a public offering by an existing public
    company that has already had its IPO.
18. Secondary Offering: A secondary offering is a new issue (could be an IPO
    or follow-on) where shares are being sold by existing investors, not the
    company. For example, if a private equity firm liquidates a position in a
    company, this is a secondary offering.
19. Shelf Registration: A shelf registration allows an issuer to preregister
    securities today and sell them at a later date when market conditions are
    favorable. A shelf is good for up to three years and can be used for both
    debt and equity follow-on offerings, but never for an IPO.
20. Best Efforts: A best efforts is a type of underwriting where the underwriters
    act as agents and have no financial responsibility for any unsold securities.
21. Restricted Persons: FINRA rules prohibit restricted persons from investing in
    an IPO of common stock. Restricted persons include broker-dealers,
    portfolio managers for their own personal accounts, employees of broker-
    dealers, as well as their immediate family members. Under this rule
    immediate family members include the spouse, parents, siblings, children,
    and in-laws of the employee of a broker-dealer. Note who is not


```
immediate family and therefore not restricted: grandparents, aunts and
uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews, and ex-spouses.
```
22. Regulation M: Reg M is an SEC rule that aims to prevent market
    manipulation of IPOs and follow-on offerings by broker-dealers.
23. Stabilization: Stabilization allows an underwriter to bid on securities in the
    open market to prevent the price from declining following an IPO. The
    underwriters are allowed to stabilize at or below the POP (public offering
    price). For example, if XYZ stock went public at $30 per share, the
    underwriters could stabilize at or below $30.

Chapter 9 – The Secondary Market and Equity Trading

1. Settlement: Settlement is the legal transfer of securities to a buyer’s
    account and cash to seller’s account. The standard settlement cycle
    varies for different securities:
        T+1  Treasures and listed options contracts
        T+2  Equities, corporate bonds and municipal bonds
          Note: Customers have a two-day grace period to pay for their
          securities under Regulation T, i.e. payment must be made by T+4.
2. Market Maker: A market maker is a special type of broker-dealer that
    “makes a market” in a particular stock. When acting in a brokerage
    (agent) capacity the firm matches two parties. When the firm is acting in
    a dealer (principal) capacity it is trading from its own account.
3. Market Maker Quotes: If a market maker is quoting a size of 10 x 5, this
    means the market maker is willing to buy 10 round lots (1,000 shares) and
    willing to sell 5 round lots (500 shares). Each round lot represents 100
    shares.
4. Dealer Capacity: When a firm acts as a principal or dealer they are a
    counterparty to the customer, trading from its own inventory. When the
    firm sells to the customer, they charge them a mark-up and when they
    buy from the customer they charge them a mark-down.
5. Backing Away: Backing away is a violation that occurs if a market maker
    fails to honor firm quotes.
6. OTC Quotes: Quotes on the OTC Pink may be one-sided, meaning both a
    bid and ask are NOT required. Quotes on national exchanges such as the
    NYSE, NASDAQ, and BATS are required to be two-sided.
7. Market Orders: Market orders are executed immediately at the best
    available price.


8. Market-On-Close: A market-on-close order is a market order that is held
    and executed near the end of trading hours as close to the closing price
    as possible.
9. Partial Execution of Customer Orders: Limit orders can be partially filled if
    the trader cannot get the entirety of the order executed. However,
    because stop orders become a market order once the order is activated,
    there is no partial execution.
10. Adjustment of Orders: On the morning of the ex-dividend date any orders
    that are entered at or below the market are adjusted downwards by the
    amount of the dividend. This includes buy limit, sell stop, and sell stop limit
    orders. Note that orders entered at or above the market, including sell
    limit, buy stop, and buy stop limit orders, are not adjusted.
11. Order Splitting: Breaking a large customer order into smaller parts is
    allowed if it will help achieve best execution for a customer. It is not
    permitted if the sole purpose is to generate higher commissions.
12. Front-Running: Front-running is a prohibited activity whereby a registered
    rep or a firm becomes aware of a large customer order and trade for his
    personal account beforehand in the hopes the large order will increase
    the stock price.
        Example: A firm receives an order from a customer to purchase
          20,000 shares of XYZ stock. If the firm buys XYZ stock for itself before
          executing the client’s order, that would be a front-running violation.
13. Trading Ahead of Research Reports: Trading ahead is a violation where a
    broker-dealer or registered representative trades a security based on
    nonpublic information contained in a research report prior to that report
    being released to the public.
14. Arbitrage: Arbitrage occurs when an investor takes advantage of a
    temporary price disparity in a security. An example is buying a stock on
    one exchange for a low price and then reselling it on another exchange
    for a higher price.
15. Spoofing: Spoofing is a form of market manipulation where a trader enters
    an order to manipulate prices to be higher or lower, with no intent to
    actually execute at the quoted price. In other words, spoofing refers to
    entering orders to entice other participants to join on the same side of the
    market, and then trading against the other market participants’ orders.
16. Pump and Dump: A pump and dump scheme is a form of securities fraud
    where an investor uses false or misleading statements to artificially inflate
    the price of an owned stock in order to resell the stock at a higher price.
    An example is when an investor is randomly solicited with positive


```
information over email or social media to purchase shares in a penny
stock or other risky investment.
```
17. Marking the Open or Close: Marking the open or marking the close is
    when a trader attempts to manipulate the opening or closing price of a
    security by entering a number of buy or sell orders just prior to the open or
    close of trading.
18. Fourth Market: The fourth market refers to a market where securities trade
    directly between institutions on a private, OTC computer network rather
    than large exchanges such as the NYSE or NASDAQ.

Chapter 10 – Economics and Monetary Policy

1. Elasticity: Elasticity refers to the sensitivity of supply and demand of a
    commodity to a change of price. If a commodity is demand elastic, that
    means that as prices change, demand will change. For example, if prices
    increase, demand will decrease, and vice versa. Alternatively, if a
    commodity is demand inelastic, a change in price will have no impact on
    demand for that product.
2. Recession: A recession is defined as a decline in gross domestic product
    (GDP) for two or more consecutive quarters.
3. Depression: A depression is defined by at least six consecutive quarters of
    negative GDP growth or a decline of at least 10% in GDP.
4. Stagflation: Stagflation is a period of slow economic growth
    accompanied by rising prices, or put differently, increase inflation
    combined with relatively high unemployment.
5. Gross Domestic Product (GDP): GDP is the total market value of good and
    services produced within a country. It is a coincident indicator.
6. Economic Stabilizer: In a recession, the government would take steps to
    increase GDP. This is sometimes referred to as an economic stabilizer.
7. Velocity of Money: The velocity of money is the rate of turnover of money,
    or how fast it is being spent. It is usually measured as a ratio comparing
    GDP to money supply. When money velocity is low, people are investing
    and saving instead of spending.
8. Inverted Yield Curve: The yield curve graphs the relationship between
    interest rates and time until maturity. An inverted yield curve occurs when
    short-term rates are higher than long-term rates and can be a sign of a
    recession.
9. Cyclical Stocks: Cyclical stocks are those that mirror the economy,
    strengthening when the economy is growing and declining as the
    economy contracts. Examples include appliance, auto, and tech stocks.


10. Defensive Stocks: Defensive stocks are those that are resistant to
    downturns in the economy because they supply consumers with basic
    needs. Examples include utility and health care stocks.
11. Impact of Inflation: Inflation describes rising prices for goods and services
    over time. Typically, as inflation increases, interest rates will also increase.
    Therefore, as inflation increases, bond prices will decrease (because of
    the inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices).
    Conversely, in a deflationary environment, interest rates are falling, and
    bonds will increase in value. Note that in an inflationary environment
    bonds with longer maturities will have a greater price decrease than
    those with shorter maturities.
12. Deflationary Environment: In a deflationary environment, outstanding
    issues of corporate bonds are more attractive than new issues. This is
    because the new issue would have a lower coupon, reflecting the
    decline in interest rates that accompanies deflation.
13. Income Statement: An income statement, also referred to as a profit and
    loss statement, reports a company’s sales, expenses, debt interest
    expense, and net income.
14. Working Capital: Working capital is a metric that helps to measure how
    much cash a company needs to finance its current operations. It can be
    calculated from a company’s balance sheet as current assets minus
    current liabilities.
15. Earnings Per Share (EPS): Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated as a
    company’s net income divided by shares outstanding. Research analysts
    commonly provide EPS estimates. Stock splits impact EPS, for instance,
    when a company initiates a reverse stock split the company’s EPS would
    increase due to same amount of earnings divided by a decreased
    number of shares outstanding.
16. P/E Ratio: The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is calculated as a company’s
    stock price divided by earnings per share.
17. PEG Ratio: In addition to the PEG ratio, the current yield (also called
    dividend yield) and cash flow yield are methods to evaluate and
    compare stocks.
18. Fundamental Analysis: Fundamental analysis predicts future value based
    on a company’s business fundamentals which include financial
    statements and company management. It differs with technical analysis,
    which bases it upon historical market data, trading patterns, and moving
    averages.
19. Moving Average: A moving average is used to help track a stock’s price
    over a period of time by updating the average price continually. The


```
shorter the timeframe being measured, the more sensitive the moving
average will be to price changes, while the longer the timeframe means
the less sensitive it will be.
```
20. Adam Smith: Adam Smith is considered the founder of classical economic
    theory, which states that the economy best functions without government
    interference.
21. Keynesian Economics: Keynesian economists believe that the economy is
    best controlled through taxation and government spending.
22. Federal Reserve: The Federal Reserve is the central banking system of the
    US. In its role of implementing monetary policy, the Fed has several tools
    including conducting open market operations, setting the discount rate,
    as well as reserve and margin requirements. To ensure compliance with
    these requirements, the Federal Reserve Board will audit member banks.
23. Federal Reserve Stimulus: When the economy is slowing, the Fed cuts
    interest rates to stimulate financial activity. This will lead to a fall in different
    interest rates such as the federal funds rate, mortgage rates, and savings
    account rates.
24. Curb Inflation: When inflation is increasing, the Fed will tighten the money
    supply by increasing interest rates. The Fed can tighten the money supply
    by increasing the discount rate, selling government securities, or raising
    the reserve requirement.
25. Discount Rate: The discount rate is the rate of interest that the Fed charges
    banks for short term loans. To ease the money supply, the Fed would lower
    the discount rate as this would allow banks to borrow at a cheaper rate.
    To tighten the money supply, the Fed would raise the discount rate as this
    would make it more expensive for banks to borrow money.
26. Order of Interest Rates: The order from highest to lowest is 1) prime rate, 2)
    broker’s call rate, 3) discount rate, and 4) federal fund rate.
27. Trade Surplus Versus Trade Deficit: A trade surplus (exports are greater
    than imports) will cause a company’s currency to appreciate. A trade
    deficit will cause the currency to depreciate.
28. Purchasing Power Parity: Purchasing power parity compares the strength
    of a country’s currency by determining how much it costs to buy the same
    basket of goods. It is used to determine the exchange rate between the
    currencies of different countries.
29. Producer Price Index: The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures inflation for
    producers of products, such as manufacturers.
30. Cost-Push Inflation: Cost-push inflation is the result of higher production
    costs and rising prices of raw materials (when the supply of goods and


```
services decreases because of an increase in production costs). This
contrasts with demand-pull inflation, which is consumer driven and is the
result of an economy’s demand exceeding its aggregate supply.
```
Chapter 11 – Customer Accounts

1. Telemarketing: FINRA and the MSRB have telemarketing rules that allow
    firms to solicit new business by cold calling potential clients. Prior to
    making a cold call, the caller must ensure the individual is not on the
    national or firm’s do-not-call list. Cold calls are permitted between 8am
    and 9pm in the time zone of the person being called.When marking the
    call, the caller is required to disclose their name, name of their firm,
    contact information for the firm, as well as the purpose of the call.
2. Do-Not-Call List: Under the telemarketing rule, once an individual is added
    to the firm’s internal do-not-call list, they remain there indefinitely.
3. Do-Not-Call List Exceptions: A registered rep can call an individual on the
    do-not-call list if the individual is an existing customer of the firm, the
    registered rep has a personal relationship with the individual, or if the
    individual has provided prior written consent.
4. New Account Form: A new account form must be completed when a
    customer opens a new brokerage account with a broker-dealer. Required
    information includes the customer’s name, address, social security
    number, employment status, investment experience and objectives. The
    firm is required to maintain a record of this form.
5. Numbered Account: A numbered account is a brokerage account that is
    represented by a symbol or number, allowing the account holder (e.g. a
    celebrity) to remain anonymous. The broker-dealer must still receive a
    written statement of ownership and proof of identity from the client.
6. Free-Riding: Free-riding is a violation under Regulation T where an investor
    sells their securities without ever paying for them. If this occurs, the
    customer’s account will be frozen for 90 days and transactions in the
    account will be limited to sell orders and purchases where the customer
    fully pays upfront prior to trade.
7. Long Margin Account Initial Minimum Equity Requirement: Under FINRA
    rules, if a customer wants to purchase less than $2,000 of stock in a margin
    account, they must deposit 100% of the purchase price. For example, if a
    customer wants to buy $1,000 of stock on margin, they must deposit the
    full $1,000. If the customer wants to purchase between $2,000 and $4,000
    in a margin account, they must deposit minimum initial equity of at least
    $2,000. For example, if a customer wants to buy $3,000 of stock on margin,


```
they must deposit $2,000. For purchases above $4,000, the customer must
deposit 50% of the purchase price (Regulation T).
```
8. Short Sales in a Margin Account: All short sales must be executed in a
    margin account. Additionally, Reg T requires the customer to deposit 50%
    of the sale price. For example, if a customer sells short $100,000 of stock,
    they are required deposit $50,000 in equity into the account.
9. Mark-to-Market: The value of a customer’s margin account is marked-to-
    market daily to determine equity balances and margin calls.
10. Marginable Securities: The Federal Reserve Board determines whether a
    security is eligible to be purchased on margin. Those that can be include
    exchange-listed stocks, closed-end funds, ETFs, fixed income securities
    (e.g. Treasury bonds), and LEAPS options with more than nine months until
    expiration. Securities that cannot be bought on margin include options
    contracts with nine months or less until expiration, mutual funds, and
    annuities contracts.
11. Hypothecation: In a margin account, the customer borrows 50% of the
    purchase price from the broker-dealer to buy securities. In return the
    customer agrees to hypothecate, meaning pledge, the securities in their
    account as collateral for the loan.
12. Loan Consent Form: The loan consent form is an optional component of
    the margin agreement. If signed by the customer, it allows the broker-
    dealer to lend stock held in the customer’s account to other investors to
    facilitate short sales.
13. Options Disclosure Document: The sequence of documentation for
    options accounts is unusual in that the customer can begin trading
    options once his or her account is approved but before he or she returns
    the signed options agreement (for 15 days).
14. Discretionary Account: A discretionary account is a brokerage account
    where the customer has given their rep at the firm the written authority to
    make investment decisions and trade on their behalf. If a rep does not
    have discretionary authority, it would be a violation for them to conduct
    trades on behalf of a customer, even if they believe the transactions are
    in the best interest of their client, without the customer’s consent.
15. Discretionary Account Approval: Discretionary accounts must be
    approved by a principal prior to the first trade and each discretionary
    trade must be approved by a principal promptly after execution.
16. Not Held Orders: A not held order is when the customer provides the asset,
    amount, and action, but allows the registered rep to choose the price
    and time of execution. For example, the customer states “Buy 100 shares


```
of XYZ stock when the price is right”. Not held orders do not require
discretionary authority.
```
17. Trading Authority: The owner of an account has trading authority, which is
    the ability to trade the assets of the account. A non-account holder can
    only trade on behalf of the account if this right is granted in writing by the
    account holder.
        Example: An adult child can only make trades for their mother’s
          brokerage account if the mother grants this authority in writing.
18. Power of Attorney (POA): An existing power of attorney (POA) would be
    cancelled if a court declares the customer legally incompetent. An
    exception exists if the customer had a durable power of attorney, which
    would remain in effect. Note that all POAs end upon death of the
    customer.
19. Fee-Based Accounts: In a fee-based account, the customer pays a flat
    fee for as many trades as they would like. This type of account would not
    be appropriate for a buy and hold investor.
20. Payments in Joint Accounts: Any party can give trading instructions in a
    joint account, but checks must be made payable to all parties.
21. Joint Accounts: The two main types of joint accounts are discussed below.

```
A. A joint tenants in common (JTIC) account is a divided account
where each account owner specifies their percentage ownership
of the account based on their contributions to the account. At
each owner’s death, their portion of the account is distributed to
their beneficiary, not the surviving account owners. JTIC account
assets are subject to probate (the inheritance process via court)
and are distributed as part of the deceased’s estate. Unrelated
friends or siblings who want to leave their assets to their respective
spouses might open at JTIC account together.
B. A joint tenants with rights of survivorship (JTWROS) account is an
undivided account, meaning all owners own 100% of the assets. If
one of the owners dies, their share of the account passes to the
surviving owners. In a JTWROS, the assets avoid probate and go
straight to the survivor. A husband and wife might open a JTWROS
account together.
```
22. Transfer on Death (TOD) Account: A TOD account has a named
    beneficiary and avoid probate. This means the assets in the account
    bypass the estate settlement process and are transferred directly to the
    beneficiary at death.


23. Minors Accounts: UGMA and UTMA accounts are securities accounts that
    can be established for a minor. Because the minor owns the account, it is
    their social security number on the account and the minor is liable for any
    taxes. However, the account is managed by a custodian, who trades on
    behalf of the minor. Technically, the securities are registered in the name
    of the custodian, for the benefit of the minor. The custodian can be the
    same individual that donates the assets to the account (e.g. a parent can
    gift the assets and be the custodian managing the account). Once the
    minor reaches the age of majority, which varies by state, they take control
    of the assets. Additionally, any assets that are gifted to the minor’s
    account are irrevocable, which means they cannot be taken back.
24. UGMA New Account Registration Form: The new account registration form
    for an UGMA account includes the name of the custodian. It would not
    include the name of an individual who donates funds to the account
    (unless the donor was also the custodian).
25. Guardian: An individual appointed by the court to manage the assets of
    a minor is referred to as a guardian.
26. Trust Account: In a trust account, a beneficiary’s assets are managed by a
    trustee. The trustee has a fiduciary responsibility, meaning they must act
    on behalf of the beneficiary by ensuring that the terms set forth in the trust
    agreement are adhered to. One benefit of a trust is that it allows the
    creator of the trust, or grantor, to limit or restrict the use of the assets. For
    example, a grandparent can set up a trust for a minor that allows the
    assets to be used for educational expenses only. Another benefit is that
    certain types of trusts can be used by a customer to ensure their assets
    avoid probate and instead go straight to the named beneficiary.
27. Trust Invalidation: A trust may be invalidated (aka overturned) due to
    undue influence (e.g. the individual signing the trust documents was
    coerced) or lack of capacity (e.g. the individual signing the trust
    documents was mentally incompetent).
28. Customer Account Statements: Account statements, which are snapshots
    of the customer’s account, must be sent at least quarterly by the firm.
29. Holding Customer Mail: If a customer will be travelling, they can request
    that their broker-dealer hold on to their mail, such as trade confirmations
    and account statements, for up to three months. The customer must make
    this request in writing.
30. Regulation S-P: Regulation S-P established privacy standards to ensure
    broker-dealers maintain the security and confidentiality of customer
    information. Reg S-P requires firm to provide clients with privacy notices at
    account opening and annually thereafter explaining what information the
    firm gathers about them, where this information is shared, and how the


```
firm safeguards this data. Clients also have the option to opt out of having
certain information shared with third parties unless at the request of a
regulator (i.e. the IRS or FINRA) or otherwise legally required. Clients must
be given 30 days to opt out.
```
31. Commingling: Customer and firm assets must be segregated from one
    another. Mixing the two is a violation referred to as commingling.
32. Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC): SIPC is a not-for-profit
    corporation that protects each separate customer account in the event
    a broker-dealer goes bankrupt. Specifically, each separate customer is
    protected for up to $500,000 total, but not more than $250,000 in cash.
    Importantly, SIPC coverage protects customers’ cash and securities from
    a broker-dealer’s failure, but not from market losses. Note, that SIPC does
    not protect non-securities, such as a commodities or futures.
33. SIPC General Creditor: If the SIPC limit of coverage is exceeded, the
    customer becomes a general credit of the broker-dealer.
34. SIPC Securities Valuation Date: In the event of a broker-dealer insolvency,
    the market value used to determine the amount of an investor’s claim is
    based on the date the bankruptcy filing is made with the court.
35. Clearing Versus Introducing Firm: A clearing firm is responsible for
    processing and settling customer transactions, as well as maintaining
    custody of customer cash and securities. This contrasts with an introducing
    firm which has the direct relationship with the client and can accept
    customer orders but does not handle customer assets or the mechanics of
    the actual trade. In a margin account, the securities positions are
    maintained by the clearing firm rather than the introducing firm.
36. Delivery Versus Payment (DVP)/ Receipt Versus Payment (RVP): A
    DVP/RVP account is used by large institutional investors to clear their
    trades. These accounts do not hold securities positions.
37. Private Banking: Private banking is the provision of banking and other
    financial services to high-net worth individuals. Financial institutions that
    offer these services are called private banks.
38. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC): A clearing corporation
    with the primary role of facilitating the exchange, payment, and
    settlement process for securities transactions. The largest clearing
    corporation is the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). It is a
    subsidiary of the DTCC, which is jointly owned by all broker-dealers.
39. Vulnerable Investors: FINRA defines vulnerable investors as those aged 65
    and older as well as any person aged 18 or older who the firm or its reps
    reasonably believe has a mental or physical impairment that renders the


```
individual unable to protect his or her own interests. If the firm believes
that there has been or will be financial exploitation of a vulnerable
investor by a party able to transact the account (e.g. the account’s
trusted contact) then the firm can institute a 15-business day hold on the
account to review the facts and circumstances. If after the 15-business
day hold the firm has reason to believe that the malfeasance is ongoing,
the hold can be extended further.
```
40. Inherited Securities’ Cost Basis: When an investor inherits securities, the
    investor’s cost basis is adjusted to the fair market value of the security at
    the time of death. This is referred to as a “stepped-up basis.”

Chapter 12 – Tax-Advantaged Accounts and Products

1. Vesting Schedule: ERISA requires that qualified corporate plans, such as
    401ks, have a vesting schedule which specifies when participants have
    ownership rights to employer contributions. Importantly, the employee’s
    own contributions vest immediately.
2. Traditional IRA (pre-tax / tax-deferred): Traditional IRA contributions are
    usually pre-tax, have tax-deferred earnings and growth, and all
    distributions are taxed as ordinary income.
3. IRA Contribution Limits: The maximum contribution to an IRA is the lesser of
    $6,500 (this was updated from $6,000 on January 1st, 2023) or 100% of the
    individual’s earned income. Note, that only earned income (e.g. salary)
    can be contributed to an IRA. Investment income, such as capital gains or
    dividends, and income from a retirement plan (e.g. a pension plan) is not
    considered earned income and therefore cannot be contributed.
        Example: If an individual earns $3,000 from a part time job, $10,000
          of investment income, and $40,000 of pension income, they can
          only contribute $3,000 to their IRA.
4. Spousal IRA: A contribution of up to $6,500 per year may be made by a
    working spouse to a spousal IRA account in the non-working spouse’s
    name.
5. Catch-Up Contribution: If an individual is 50 or older, they can contribute
    an additional $1,000 to their IRA ($7,500 total).
6. Excess Contributions: If an investor makes an excess contribution (e.g.
    more than $6,500) to a Traditional or Roth IRA, they will be assessed a 6%
    tax penalty by the IRS.
7. IRA Rollovers: Individuals can move their IRA investments from one plan
    provider to another (e.g. Fidelity to Wells Fargo). This is referred to as a
    rollover and must be completed within 60 days to avoid potential tax
    liabilities and early withdrawal penalties.


8. Roth IRA (post-tax / tax-free): Contributions to a Roth IRA are always
    made with after-tax dollars. The earnings in the plan grow and
    accumulate tax-free and qualified distributions from a Roth are tax-free.
    To be qualified, distributions must be made after reaching age 59 ½ and
    the money must have been in the plan for at least five years.
9. Roth IRA Eligibility: An individual is only eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA
    if their modified adjusted gross income is below a certain threshold. In
    2020, the limit is $139,000 and this figure is adjusted annually for inflation.
    Focus on the concept rather than memorizing the specific threshold.
10. Roth IRA Early Withdrawals: An individual under age 59.5 with a valid
    exception (e.g. first-time home buyer, qualified education expenses,
    death, disability, and major medical expenses) can withdraw funds from a
    Roth IRA that they have had for less than five years without being subject
    to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. However, in this situation the individual
    will be taxed on the earnings.
11. Required Minimum Distributions (RMD): The owner of a traditional IRA is
    required to begin taking distributions from the account by April 1st of the
    year following their turning 72. The amount they are required to withdraw
    is referred to as the RMD and is calculated based on the owner’s account
    value and life expectancy. For Roth IRAs, because there is no age limit for
    making contributions, RMDs are not required from a Roth IRA until death of
    the account owner.
12. SEP-IRA: A simplified employee pension (SEP-IRA) is a type of employer-
    sponsored retirement plan that is typically offered by small businesses
    because it is inexpensive to set up and maintain. Instead of companies
    having to establish a new plan, a SEP-IRA allows the company to
    contribute directly to each employee’s IRA. Take note that only the
    employer, not the employee, can contribute to a SEP-IRA.
13. Simple IRA: A Savings Inventive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) is a
    type of employer sponsored retirement plan available to small businesses.
    It can only be used by companies that have 100 employees or less.
14. Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC): A GIC is an insurance contract
    that function like a time deposit. An investor agrees to deposit cash with
    the insurance company for a fixed period and in return the insurance
    company provides them with a guaranteed rate of interest as well as the
    return of principal.
15. Fixed Versus Variable Annuities: In a fixed annuity, the investor earns a
    guaranteed fixed return. The risk of negative performance of the
    investments is assumed by the insurance company. However, the investor
    still faces inflationary risk (the fixed return will not keep place with inflation).
    In a variable annuity, the investor earns a variable return based on the


```
market performance of the investments they select within the insurance
company’s separate account. The investor bears the risk of any reduced
payout (market risk). A variable annuity calculates the market value of its
separate account units daily.
```
16. General Versus Separate Account: The general account of the insurance
    company seeks to provide a fixed return by investing customer premiums
    into conservative investment options, such as Treasury securities and high-
    grade corporate bonds. The separate account of the insurance company
    seeks to provide a variable return by investing in a wider range of
    securities including equities and mutual funds.
17. Accumulation Units: When an individual invests money into a variable
    annuity, the dollars invested into the insurance company’s separate
    account purchase accumulation units. Each unit represents an interest in
    the underlying subaccount. The value of each unit will fluctuate based on
    the value of the securities in the portfolio. Therefore, both the number of
    accumulation units will vary (the number will increase as the individual
    invests more money) as will the value of each unit.
18. Variable Annuity Payouts: The payouts received by an investor from their
    variable annuity will fluctuate each month based on the performance of
    their separate account.
19. Variable Annuity Payout Options: When an investor annuitizes, they begin
    to receive payments from the insurance company. One factor that
    impacts their monthly payment is the payout option the investor has
    chosen. A life option or life annuity makes payments for the life of the
    investor, but no payments to their beneficiary upon death. In contrast, a
    joint and last survivor option guarantees payments over two lives. Once
    the investor dies, the insurance company will then make payments to the
    beneficiary until their death. Because the life option is expected to have a
    shorter duration and is therefore riskier to the investor, it makes higher
    monthly payments.
20. Surrender Charges: A surrender charge is a fee paid by an investor to the
    insurance company if the investor withdraws their capital prior to
    annuitization.
21. 1035 Exchange: A 1035 exchange allows an investor to transfer from one
    variable annuity to another with no tax consequences. Note that
    surrender charges may still apply.
22. 403(b) Plans: A tax-sheltered annuity, also known as a 403(b) plan, is a
    retirement plan used by employees of public schools and non-profits.
    Similar to a 401(k), it allows individuals to make pre-tax (tax-deductible)
    contributions. The investments in the plan grow tax-deferred and all
    distributions from the plan are taxed as ordinary income.


23. 529 Plan: A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged to save for education.
    Contributions to the plan are made with after-tax dollars. The earnings in
    the plan grow and accumulate tax-free and distributions for qualified
    education (e.g. tuition and books) are completely tax-free at the federal
    level. Technically, because 529 plans are offered by states, the maximum
    amount that can be contributed will vary state to state. Additionally, there
    is no age limit on the beneficiary of a 529 plan. While a 529 plan is set up
    typically for a minor, a parent can open a 529 for themselves if the
    distributions are used for qualified educational expenses. An adult can
    also set up a 529 plan regardless of income.
24. Coverdell Education Savings Account: Similar to 529 plans, a Coverdell is
    another tax-advantaged investment account to save for education. The
    tax treatment is identical to that of a 529 plan. However, 529 plans are the
    much more popular of the two plans as a Coverdell has a much lower
    maximum contribution limit: $2,000 per year per child. Additionally, a
    Coverdell can be opened for any student who is under the age of 18, but
    the assets must be withdrawn or transferred by the time the student
    reaches the age of 30.
25. ABLE Accounts: An ABLE account is a tax-advantaged savings account
    for individuals with disabilities. It may be opened for persons with
    disabilities up to the age of 26. It allows for a donor to contribute after-tax
    dollars on behalf of an individual with disabilities. The earnings in the plan
    grow and accumulate tax-free and distributions for qualified disability
    expenses (e.g. education, housing, health care, transportation, etc.) are
    completely tax-free at the federal level.
26. Non-Qualified Retirement Plans – Credit Risk: Non-qualified corporate
    retirement plans carry credit risk if the employer is insolvent or files for
    bankruptcy. A non-qualified plan does not meet certain federal legal
    requirements under ERISA (the federal law). The ERISA criteria are not
    tested.

Chapter 13 – FINRA Registration

1. SEC Mission: The primary mission of the SEC is to maintain integrity of US
    markets and protect investors. FINRA is overseen by the SEC and its
    primary mission is to regulate broker-dealers and registered
    representatives. FINRA can make rules but they must be approved by the
    SEC before they are effective.
2. Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO): A SRO is a regulatory body,
    empowered by and accountable to the SEC, that has been delegated
    certain enforcement responsibilities within the securities industry. The
    primary mission of SROs is to provide investor protection and promote


```
market integrity. Examples include FINRA and the MSRB. Note that the SEC
is a government agency, not an SRO.
```
3. Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB): The MSRB is SRO
    responsible for regulating the municipal securities industry. Importantly, the
    MSRB regulates municipal securities firms, advisors, and professionals, but
    not municipal issuers. Municipal issuers (e.g. New York City) are not subject
    to regulation by the SEC or SROs.
4. MSRB Rules: Although the MSRB creates rules, it has no enforcement
    authority. Instead, MSRB rules are enforced by FINRA and other regulators.
5. Pre-Dispute Arbitration Clause: FINRA rules require all registered
    representatives to sign a pre-dispute arbitration agreement as part of their
    Form U4. This clause requires any future dispute between the firm and rep,
    for example a financial disagreement, to be settled through an arbitration
    proceeding rather than the court. An exception is that any disputes
    regarding harassment or discrimination will only go to arbitration if both
    the firm and employee agree; otherwise, they will go to the court.
6. Arbitrators: FINRA arbitrators can be from both inside the industry and
    outside the industry. Those from outside are called public arbitrators. A law
    degree is not a required credential for arbitrators. Industry cases are
    decided by industry arbitrators, while cases involving the public must
    include arbitrators from the public sector. An arbitration panel will have no
    more than three arbitrators.
7. Fingerprinting Requirements: All registered reps of a broker-dealer must
    submit fingerprints to FINRA as part of their registration. This requirement
    also applies to any partners of the firm or clerical staff who are involved in
    the handling or processing of securities or money. However, a partner of
    the firm or clerical employee not involved in those activities are exempt
    from fingerprinting requirements. For example, a partner of a broker-
    dealer, who has invested capital into the firm, but has no other
    involvement (e.g. a silent partner) is not required to submit fingerprints.
8. Fingerprinting Timeline: Fingerprints must be received within 30 days after
    a Form U4 is filed. If the fingerprints are not received within 30 days, the
    individual’s FINRA registration status will be changed to “inactive prints”
    and the individual will have to cease conducting securities business until
    the fingerprints are processed.
9. Passing the SIE: When an individual passes the SIE exam, it does not qualify
    them to engage in securities business (e.g. solicit business or enter
    transactions). Instead, to become fully registered, the individual must also
    pass a top-off exam (e.g. Series 7 or Series 79). Note, the SIE credential is
    valid for four years.


10. Amended U4: All individuals seeking to be registered must complete a
    Form U4 upon joining a broker-dealer. Additionally, firms and reps have an
    obligation to amend and update any information required by Form U4 as
    changes occur within 30 days. For example, if an individual engages in an
    outside business activity away from the firm, changes their address, or has
    lien (e.g. tax lien) filed against them, an amended U4 must be filed. Note
    that if the individual is subject to a statutory disqualification, the amended
    U4 must be filed within 10 days.
11. Registered Rep Credit: Registered reps are required to notify compliance
    of any activity that may impact their credit. One example of such activity
    is a short sale of a home (mortgage) by a registered rep. This occurs if a
    rep sells a home for less than the outstanding mortgage balance owed to
    the lender (i.e. bank), with the bank then accepting the less-than-full
    repayment of the mortgage. Because the rep is unable to pay off their
    mortgage balance in full, this will have a negative impact to their credit.
12. Form U5: A firm must file a Form U5 electronically with FINRA within 30 days
    of a registered rep’s termination. The firm must provide a copy of the U5 to
    the departing rep within 30 days and keep the terminated rep’s file
    updated for two years after termination.
13. Registered Rep Termination: After a registered representative is terminated
    from a firm (i.e. a Form U5 is filed), the individual must keep their address
    updated with FINRA for two years after termination.
14. Statutory Disqualification: A statutory disqualification will occur if within the
    past ten years the individual has been convicted of a felony or a securities
    related misdemeanor. In this situation, the individual cannot be employed
    with a broker-dealer unless they receive a waiver from FINRA. If an
    applicant answers a question on their U4 falsely, the applicant might face
    possible sanctions, including statutory disqualification from registration.
15. FINRA Investigation: If FINRA believes that a registered rep has committed
    a rules violation, they can investigate the matter. As part of this
    investigation, FINRA will typically send a written request for information to
    both the firm and rep, which seeks basic information about the event or
    complaint. Additionally, FINRA can require that the rep submit to an
    interview and meet with regulators as part of the investigation.
16. Regulatory Element: Regulatory element continuing education must be
    completed annually by December 31st. This is a rule change as of January
    1 st, 2023.
17. Firm Element: Firm element continuing education must be completed at
    least annually, though firm policies can require it to be completed more
    frequently. It must be completed by all covered persons, meaning all
    registered individuals and supervisors who interact with customers.


18. State Securities Laws: In addition to federal regulations, each state has
    securities laws in place designed to protect the investing public. These
    state regulations are often referred to as blue sky laws.
19. NASAA: The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)
    is a membership organization for state securities administrators.
20. State Registration: Registered reps must be registered in each state they
    conduct business. If a client of a registered rep moves to another state,
    the rep cannot make a trade for that client until becoming registered in
    that state. If the client wishes to trade, the rep should forward the trade to
    someone at the firm who is registered in that state.
21. Fiduciary Standard: Fiduciaries are legally obligated to act in the best
    interest of persons they represent. Examples of fiduciaries includes
    administrators of pension plans and Investment Advisers. Importantly,
    representatives of broker-dealers are not subject to a fiduciary standard.
    Instead, they are subject to a suitability standard.
22. Investment Advisers: Investment advisers (IAs) are firms that provide
    securities related advice for a fee. Larger advisers (defined as those with
    over $100mm in assets under management) must register with the SEC.
    Smaller advisers, those with less than $100mm in assets, must register in
    each state they operate.

Chapter 14 – Business Conduct Rules

1. Broker-dealer Books & Records (including advertisements): Broker-dealers’
    business records, which include advertisements, must be maintained for
    three years after the record is created. In the case of an advertisement
    used multiple times, the three-year clock restarts each time the ad is
    deployed. For the first two years of the record retention period the record
    must be easily accessible (i.e. stored on-site).
2. Insider Trading: Insider trading is the illegal practice of trading (buying or
    selling) securities based on material non-public information.
3. Information Barriers: The Insider Trading Act requires broker-dealers to
    establish information barriers that prevent the free flow of material,
    nonpublic information.
4. Inside Information: If a registered rep holds non-public material
    information, they can accept an unsolicited order from a customer.
5. Liability for Insider Trading: Under insider tradition regulations, both the
    tipper who provides the non-public information and the tippee who
    trades on the information are liable.


6. Penalties for Insider Trading: The 1934 Act provides for both civil and
    criminal penalties for insider trading. Civil penalties up to a maximum of
    three times the profits gained, or losses avoided. This is also referred to as
    treble damages. Criminal penalties include up to $5 million in fines and 20
    years in prison.
7. Bureaus within US Treasury Department: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS),
    Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Financial Crimes
    Enforcement Network (FinCen) are all bureaus of the US Treasury
    Department that help to prevent money laundering.
8. Role of the IRS: The IRS is responsible for the collection of taxes and
    enforcement of tax laws. However, it is the responsibility of Congress to
    pass tax legislation.
9. Currency Transaction Report (CTR): A CTR must be filed with FinCEN
    whenever a financial institution receives a cash deposit in excess of
    $10,000 in a single business day from a customer. This can include a
    deposit of cash, a traveler’s check, a cashier’s check, money order, or a
    combination of the aforementioned which exceeds the limit. For
    example, if a customer deposits a $3,000 money order and $8,000
    traveler’s check in a single day, a CTR must be filed.
10. Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR): A SAR must be filed with FinCEN upon
    discovery of suspicious activity. Examples include insufficient or
    questionable account information, avoidance of recordkeeping
    requirements, unanticipated changes in transaction patterns, and
    inconsistent business activity, which are all red flags for suspicion of money
    laundering activity.
11. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance Programs: AML compliance
    programs are subject to annual independent audit and testing. The
    testing can be completed by someone from within or outside the firm.
12. Phases of Money Laundering: The three phases of money laundering in
    order are placement, layering, and integration.
13. Customer Identification Program (CIP): The Customer Identification
    Program is a provision of the USA Patriot Act that requires financial
    institutions to verify the identity of each customer who opens an account.
    The purpose is to help the government fight terrorism and money
    laundering activities.
14. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC): OFAC is a part of the US Treasury
    Department that maintains a list of individuals with whom transactions are
    prohibited (e.g., known terrorists).
15. Outside Business Activities (OBAs): A registered rep that wishes to engage
    in outside employment (e.g. a second job) away from their firm must


```
notify their firm prior to engaging in the activity. For example, a registered
rep that wants to accept a weekend job as a bartender must first notify
their firm. Note that passive investments are exempt from the rule (i.e. do
not require notification).
```
16. Selling Away: Sometimes referred to as private securities transactions,
    selling away is when a registered rep conducts securities business away
    from their firm. FINRA rules require the rep to notify their firm of this activity
    and if the rep will receive any compensation to first receive permission
    from their firm.
17. Sharing in Customer Accounts: A registered rep and customer can share
    in the profits and losses in an account only with permission of the firm and
    customer. The sharing must be proportionate to each person’s financial
    contribution to the account. A registered rep does not need permission
    from their firm to be a beneficiary to a trust account.
18. Unregistered Persons Compensation: Broker-dealers and their registered
    representatives are not permitted to pay or compensate unregistered
    persons in connection with securities transactions or business.
19. Continuing Commissions: A retired registered rep who had a continuing
    commissions arrangement as part of their retirement can continue to
    receive commissions for legacy clients even after the rep’s retirement.
20. Gifts and Entertainment: Under FINRA and MSRB rules, gifts to a client or
    potential client are limited to $100 per client per year. However,
    entertainment expenses – events where the rep attends – are not
    considered gifts. For example, if a rep takes a client to dinner and the bill
    is $250, this is permitted. Likewise, attending a baseball game where the
    tickets cost more than $100 is permitted provided the rep attends.
        When valuing tickets under the gift limit rule, a broker-dealer should
          use the higher of the cost or face value of the tickets. For example,
          if a registered representative purchases a ticket for $250 that has a
          face value of $100 and gifts the ticket to a client this would be a
          violation assuming the registered rep does not attend along with
          client since the cost of $250 exceeds the $100 limit.
21. Borrowing from or Lending to Members: Registered reps are generally
    prohibited from personally lending money to clients unless the firm has
    written procedures in place allowing for the activity. Assuming that is the
    case, a registered rep is allowed to lend or borrow money from a client
    with no notice or permission required if the client is a bank or family
    member. Firm permission is required if the loan is based on an outside
    business or personal relationship with the client or if the client is a
    registered person at the same firm.


22. Customer Complaints: Under FINRA and MSRB rules, all written complaints
    must be forwarded to a supervisor. Note, that verbal complaints do not
    need to be reported.
23. Heightened Supervision: A firm would likely heighten its supervision over a
    registered representative who had a history of notable events on their
    Form U4 (e.g. customer complaints).
24. Political Contributions: The MSRB has strict political contribution rules to
    prevent pay-to-play, which is the practice of municipal firms and their
    representatives making contributions to candidates in exchange for
    receiving business opportunities. These rules apply to municipal finance
    professionals (MFPs), which is any rep involved with municipal securities
    business except for those limited to retail sales. Specifically, an MFP can
    give a maximum contribution of $250 per election to a candidate they
    are eligible to vote for. If a violation occurs, the firm is prohibited from
    doing any negotiated business with that municipality for two years. Note
    that contributions made by spouses of MFPs are not subject to the $250
    limit unless the contribution was directed by the MFP.
25. Annual Compliance Meeting: To ensure that a firm’s supervisory
    procedures and all FINRA rules are being adhered to, all registered
    employees must attend an annual compliance meeting conducted by
    the firm’s chief compliance officer. The meeting may be conducted
    electronically (e.g. by video conference), but all participants must have
    the opportunity to ask questions and receive immediate feedback.
26. Retail Communications: Retail communications include any written or
    electronic communication distributed to more than 25 retail investors
    within a 30-calendar-day period. Because these communications are
    seen by individuals, they require principal approval before first use and
    are highly regulated. For example, retail communications cannot predict
    or project the performance of a security, imply that past performance
    forecasts future results, or include exaggerated claims. Take note that the
    following activities would be permitted:
       I. A hypothetical illustration of mathematical principles, as long as it
          does not specifically predict or project the performance of an
          investment or investment strategy, and
II. A price target, but only if contained in a research report.
27. Communications through Personal Email & Social Media: A registered rep
    can communicate with clients through a personal email address and
    personal social media account as long as they receive prior permission
    from their supervisor and the firm appropriately monitors the
    communications. Supervision is required for contacts with both current
    and prospective investors.


28. Business Continuity Plans: All firms must have a written business continuity
    plan to address emergencies and business disruption. Customer must
    receive a summary of the plan at account opening and it must be on the
    firm’s website. Customers must also be mailed a summary of the plan
    upon request.
